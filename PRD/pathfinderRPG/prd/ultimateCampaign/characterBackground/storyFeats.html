<h1 id="story-feats" id="story-feats">Story Feats</h1>
<p>A story feat reflects a goal&mdash;often an all-consuming one&mdash;that shapes your life. Each story feat incorporates a trigger event (which comes from either a campaign occurrence or your background), an immediate benefit, a goal, and a further benefit for achieving that goal.</p>
<p>Story feats are marked with the story keyword. Each feat has at least two possible prerequisites, representing conditions most likely met during play or a background that fits the feat. You need to meet only one of these prerequisites. Anytime you gain a new feat, you may take a story feat, but you can have only one uncompleted story feat at a time. Story feats are designed for PCs, but can be taken by NPCs and monsters as well.</p>
<p>Unlike typical feats, story feats have nebulous prerequisites, and you should chose one only after talking with the GM. The GM should weave a story feat into the greater story of the campaign and even adjust it as needed to fit the campaign's long-term goals and the specifics of your background. Story feats should work organically within the story of the campaign, rather than be chosen purely for their mechanical benefits.</p>
<p>Like the prerequisites, the completion conditions for a story feat might require GM adjudication. If the events of the campaign are not likely to resolve the story implied by the story feat, the GM should consider shifting the goal to something you can achieve. Establishing a meaningful story arc is more important than adhering to the letter of the feat.</p>
<p>Because a story feat represents both your motivation and character development, the GM should make an effort to incorporate elements related to the feat into the ongoing campaign. These can be direct elements, like the appearance of a villain or hated creature, or indirect elements, such as rumors of the fate of a lost relative or NPCs who are impressed by a PC's artistic endeavors. A good rule of thumb is to work in a reference to each PC's story feat once every three to five sessions.</p>
<p>In most cases, allies can assist in completing a story feat. At the GM's discretion, if you do not take a leadership role in tasks or conflicts related to your own story feat, you might need to complete additional goals to resolve the story feat, or might even be denied completion altogether.</p>


<h3 id="common-rules">Common Rules</h3>
<p>Many story feats share similar terminology in their prerequisites and completion conditions. The following terms have special meanings when used in story feats.</p>
<p><b>Appropriate Number</b>: These are either creatures whose individual CRs add up to 20, or creatures whose individual CRs add up to 5 times your character level, whichever is greater. For example, if you're at 6th level, an appropriate number of creatures have CRs that add up to 30. This calculation is based on your current character level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. Overly easy challenges (encounters with CRs of 3 or more below your character level) don't count unless circumstances make them much more difficult to handle.</p>
<p><b>Challenging Foe</b>: This is a foe or group of foes with a total CR of 10 or a CR of 3 plus your character level, whichever is higher. If this refers to a distinct individual, the foe's CR is set when the feat is taken, but the foe advances in power as you do. Otherwise, it refers to your current level. A typical recurring foe advances in CR by 1 for every 1&mdash;2 levels you gain.</p>
<p><b>Character's Level</b>: Normally, this is your actual character level. If you're a creature best represented by CR rather than character level (such as most monsters with more than 1 HD), use your calculated CR instead of your character level.</p>
<p><b>Decisively Defeat</b>: You overcome a foe in some way, such as by killing the creature, knocking it unconscious, or causing it to be taken prisoner. You must be a significant participant in the conflict to defeat the opponent, even if another strikes the final blow. Whether or not merely causing the enemy to flee qualifies is up to the GM. Generally, driving off an enemy while causing little actual harm does not qualify as a decisive defeat.</p>
<p><b>Slay</b>: Slaying a foe includes killing it, destroying it, turning it to stone, banishing it to the Abyss, or otherwise eliminating it in a fashion reversible only by powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, you must deal the final blow yourself to slay a creature.</p>
<p><b>Thwart</b>: Distinct from defeating a foe, thwarting a foe involves disrupting its plans in a substantial and essentially permanent fashion. Deposing a lord, bringing down a priest's temple, or banishing a sorcerer to the depths of Hell all qualify as thwarting. You keep any benefits gained by thwarting a foe even if it survives defeat and returns more powerful than before. You must be a significant participant in the events that lead to your foe being thwarted for your actions to count toward fulfilling a story requirement.</p>


<h3 id="story-feats-and-stacking">Story Feats and Stacking</h3>
<p>Most story feat bonuses are untyped, and stack with almost any other bonus. However, if you have multiple story feats, their untyped bonuses do not stack with each other. For example, if two story feats gave you a bonus on saving throws, you would add only the higher bonus. </p>


<p id="accursed-(story)" class="stat-block-title">Accursed (Story)</p>
<p>Your curse weighs down your soul like a millstone around your neck.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: You must carry a curse that can be lifted only by a quest or similar great undertaking, or have the Cursed Birth background.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level, as the curse interferes with all magic. Unlike most spell resistance, it can't voluntarily be lowered, though your own spells and magic items still automatically affect you.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Your curse is lifted or you are able to purge the corruption of your fiendish blood (the circumstances of either vary widely based on the nature of the curse, and are up to the GM).</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You lose the spell resistance described above. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your character level, but only against harmful enchantment, necromancy, and transmutation spells and spell-like abilities&mdash;your aura resists further attempts to curse you. Harmless spells automatically bypass this spell resistance whether you desire it or not. This spell resistance can be voluntarily lowered.</p>

<p><b>Goal</b>: You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity's chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon&mdash;a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM's choice.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: As a swift action, you can declare a single combat challenge to one foe within 50 feet and in line of sight. Upon doing so, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against that foe as long as no one else threatens that opponent or until the single combat challenge ends. If another combatant attacks you or your foe, the challenge ends and you take a &mdash;2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC for 1 round. Though you can declare a single combat challenge at will, once you declare it on a foe you can't declare it on the same foe for another 24 hours.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Defeat an appropriate number of challenging foes in single combat. These combats must not be interrupted by other creatures, and the foes must not have already been substantially injured or impaired prior to combat with you.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based checks involving evil-aligned outsiders and +1 bonus to the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against such creatures. You take a &mdash;2 penalty on Charisma-based checks involving good-aligned outsiders.</p>

<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement bonus can't be dispelled or removed save by the direct intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass spell resistance) against good-aligned outsiders. If you die while under the effects of this agreement, you can't be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider permits it. You lose your completion benefits immediately and permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which you traded your soul, though you keep the feat's basic benefits.</p>


<p id="deny-the-reaper-(story)" class="stat-block-title">Deny the Reaper (Story)</p>
<p>The lives you could not save stay with you to your final breath.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: You must have witnessed the death of a close companion in battle&mdash;a death that could have been prevented, such as from bleeding, failure to stabilize, or ongoing poison damage&mdash;or have the Death in the Family or The War background.</p>

<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You and each ally within 10 feet of you gain a +2 bonus on saves against death effects.

<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: The save DCs for any spells you create increase by 1 when you cast them. In addition, when applying metamagic feats to self-created spells, reduce the total level adjustment by 1. You can't reduce metamagic costs to lower than the spell's original level in this manner.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: For a self-created spell to benefit from this feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered from the original (for example, <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/delayedBlastFireball.html#delayed-blast-fireball"  >delayed blast fireball</a></i> as compared to <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/fireball.html#fireball"  >fireball</a></i>) gain no benefit.

You must choose to add this bonus after the die has been rolled and success or failure determined, but before any results (such as damage) are rolled and applied. If you have 10 or more levels or hit dice, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Die in pursuit of your faith's goals and be brought back to life. If you die in circumstances that don't involve your faith, you gain no benefit. If your GM permits, you can instead remain dead and create a new PC inspired by your heroic sacrifice.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: If you died and came back, you become a living symbol of faith. Once per day as a standard action, you can inspire those who share your faith to great effort, granting them a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect. If you create a new character inspired by your previous character, the new PC receives a +2 bonus to a single ability score. This ability score can't be one that already has a racial bonus. The new PC can later take this feat if he meets the prerequisite.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: The save DCs for your spells or abilities increase by 1 when you use them against the chosen group, and you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against their attacks.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Slay an appropriate number of challenging foes.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You gain the benefits of the <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-critical"  >Improved Critical</a> feat on attacks made against members of your chosen race. Your dodge bonus to AC against such foes increases to +2.</p>

If you have 10 or more ranks in <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception"  >Perception</a>, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Regain a major portion of your lost memories. The exact means varies, possibly requiring a <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/wish.html#wish"  >wish</a></i>, assistance from a divine being, reliving a past life, or confronting the situation that led to your memory loss. This process must involve encountering a challenging foe, though possibly in ways other than direct confrontation.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You roll twice whenever you attempt a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, keeping the better result.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: Restoration of memories by means less significant than <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/miracle.html#miracle"  >miracle</a></i> or <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/wish.html#wish"  >wish</a></i> does not qualify for the prerequisite.</p>

In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against fear effects.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Be killed or driven insane (as determined by the GM) by an aberration, evil outsider, or undead. This leaves your mind permanently marked.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: Any sane creature that attempts to read your thoughts takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modified negates). In addition, the effect of any ability damage, ability drain, or penalty to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is halved (minimum 1). You take a &mdash;2 penalty on Will saving throws. Whenever you roll a save against a mind-affecting effect, roll twice and keep the better result.</p>

<p>A past humiliation haunts you to this day.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: You must have been publicly embarrassed, or must have the Bastard Born background. If the embarrassment didn't cause significant harm to your personal honor or social standing, it does not qualify for the feat prerequisites.

<p><b>Goal</b>: You can complete this goal in one of two fashions. First, thwart a chosen foe in a fashion that clearly establishes your superiority to the general public. Second, prove your worth another way, like gaining a title or becoming the chosen hero of a region.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: Your newfound confidence gives you temporary hit points equal to your character level. These temporary hit points last until lost and refresh any time you rest long enough for natural healing to occur, whether or not any healing actually occurs.</p>

When you trigger a trap, you can attempt a <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device"  >Disable Device</a> check with a &mdash;5 penalty to interrupt the trap's function, leaving it still armed but effectively preventing it from activating. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. Since the trap is still armed, it might activate again if you don't immediately back away or otherwise avoid repeating the act that set it off the first time.</p>

<p>This town needs cleaning up, and you're just the one to do it.</p>

<p><b>Goal</b>: Defeat 10 more troublemakers in your chosen settlement with a CR equal to your character level or higher, and in the process eliminate a serious criminal threat or otherwise clean up the streets.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You gain the ability to designate a new chosen settlement as often as you wish. You must first live in a settlement for 1 week to make it your chosen settlement. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on saving throws when in your chosen settlement.</p>


<p id="true-love-(story)" class="stat-block-title">True Love (Story)</p>
<p>You found love, only to have it denied by the cruelty of fate.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: You must have found love with a person you can't be with, have a current lover, or have the Current Lover, For Love, or The Lover background. Possible complications include distance, your love being with another, your feelings being unrequited, or your relationship being forbidden.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You add 1 to the save DC and caster level of your spells and spell-like abilities with the emotion descriptor. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive"  >Sense Motive</a> checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive"  >Sense Motive</a>, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Find a way to be with your true love (even if you can't formally wed).</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: The inspiration of knowing your love waits for your return gives you a +2 bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks whenever you are below a quarter of your total hit points (not counting any temporary hit points). You lose this completion benefit if your relationship with your true love comes to an end for any reason, including death.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: At the GM's discretion, you can find true love with a person other than the one you designated when you chose this feat. In this case, the love you initially chose was wrong for you, but this became obvious only when you found the one truly meant for you.</p>


<p id="unforgotten-(story)" class="stat-block-title">Unforgotten (Story)</p>
<p>You search for a person dear to you&mdash;lost, but you pray not dead.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: You must have a close relative, spouse, or other person dear to your heart who never returned from a journey, was captured, or otherwise vanished with little trace, or you have the Major Disaster background.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Your dogged determination reduces any nonlethal damage you take by 1 point, to a minimum of 1 point of nonlethal damage. You also gain a +1 bonus on Will saves.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b>: Find your lost loved one alive, and in the process, decisively defeat a challenging foe who kept you apart.</p>
<p><b>Completion Benefit</b>: You gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws, replacing the +1 bonus on Will saves. If you find your loved one dead, you lose all benefits from this feat until you put the body and possibly soul to proper rest. Putting the body to rest restores the completion benefit, but you don't regain the ability to reduce nonlethal damage.</p>


<p id="vengeance-(story)" class="stat-block-title">Vengeance (Story)</p>
<p>The need to avenge those you loved drives you to great deeds.</p>
