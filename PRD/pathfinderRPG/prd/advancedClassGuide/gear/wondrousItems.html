<p>Wondrous items are diverse. Some must be worn in a specific magic item slot in order to work, while others must merely be possessed and utilized. "Wondrous item" is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into other groups such as weapons, staves, and so on. Anyone can use a wondrous item, unless the item specifies otherwise.</p>
<p>There are two main categories of wondrous items: slotted and slotless. Slotted items take up a magic item slot, and must be worn by those who want to benefit from them.</p>

The claws are treated as natural weapons, and allows the wearer to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using his full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if the wearer is Small) plus the wearer's Strength modifier.

Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can fix his gaze on any one creature within 60 feet. The target becomes staggered for 4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 18). Only one target can be affected by the wearer's gaze at a time; if the wearer attempts to stagger a new opponent, the previous target immediately recovers whether the new attempt is successful or not.

Against evil creatures, the ray deals 1d4+4 points of damage. The damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. The ray heals good creatures of 1d4+4 points of damage, but a good creature cannot benefit from the heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are unaffected by the ray.

<p class = "stat-block"><em>Destined</em>: This chunk of uncut quartz hangs on a platinum chain.

He must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the result is revealed. He must take the second result, even if it's lower.

<p class = "stat-block"><em>Battle</em>: This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds.

<p class = "stat-block"><em>Bones</em>: This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones.

In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates).

<p class = "stat-block"><em>Flame</em>: This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal.

<p class = "stat-block"><em>Heavens</em>: This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

<p class = "stat-block"><em>Life</em>: This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/cureLightWounds.html#cure-light-wounds" >cure light wounds</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/inflictModerateWounds.html#inflict-moderate-wounds" >inflict moderate wounds</a></em>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Stone</em>: This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a &ndash;4 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/heatMetal.html#heat-metal" >heat metal</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/stoneskin.html#stoneskin" >stoneskin</a></em>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Waves</em>: This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blur.html#blur" >blur</a></em> spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blur.html#blur" >blur</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/chillTouch.html#chill-touch" >chill touch</a>.</em></p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Wind</em>: This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy.

The horn typically appears empty, but once per day a creature holding it can command it to fill with a liquid that has the effect of one of four spells when consumed: <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/cureSeriousWounds.html#cure-serious-wounds" >cure serious wounds</a></em>,<em> <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/neutralizePoison.html#neutralize-poison" >neutralize poison</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/removeDisease.html#remove-disease" >remove disease</a></em>, or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/restoration.html#restoration-lesser" >lesser restoration</a></em>. Consuming a drink from the horn is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. No matter the spell chosen, the drink in the horn has the appearance and honeyed fragrance of summer mead. If the liquid is not consumed within 1 minute or is spilled from the horn, its effects are wasted.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This elixir's magic functions instantaneously and can't be dispelled, though drinking a second <em>elixir of sex shift</em> either reverts the character back to a former form or allows them to adopt alternate sexual characteristics, as they choose. The elixir has no effect on characters who are pregnant or are of races with no sexual differentiation. Most races have a wide spectrum of sexual differentiation, some common, others more rare. Therefore, most creatures can decide how this elixir transforms them. An unwilling imbiber can choose not to change at all.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This item appears to be a wooden puzzle box approximately 3 inches on a side. When the box is placed on the ground beneath the boughs of a tree with a trunk at least 2 feet in diameter and the command word is spoken, the box unfolds and rises, melding with the tree. It becomes a stable structure attached to the limbs 20 feet above ground level, with a rope ladder hanging down from a trapdoor on the underside of the platform. The outer surfaces of the tree fort take on the visual characteristics of the tree in which it is erected, and require a DC 25 <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> check to notice (DC 15 in a dead tree or tree that has shed its leaves). There are two forms the tree fort can take, chosen at the time the device is activated.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Tree House</em>: This version of the tree fort unfolds into a 20-foot-square, open-air platform with railings on all four sides but no roof.

Creatures standing in the tree house gain the benefits of partial cover against opponents on the ground, while those who are prone within it have total cover.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Blind</em>: This version of the tree fort forms into a 5-foot-square hunting blind. It is enclosed on all sides, has a roof, and is equipped with a number of narrow horizontal windows for watching or shooting from any side.

<p class = "stat-block">In either form, a <em>hunter's tree fort</em> remains open for up to 12 hours in any 24-hour period; these hours of use don't need to be consecutive.

<p class = "stat-block">These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though <em>preyfinders</em> function as standard compasses, making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">To use a <em>preyfinder</em>, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the <em>preyfinder's</em> tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the <em>preyfinder</em> can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the <em>preyfinder's</em> magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the <em>preyfinder</em> telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the <em>preyfinder's</em> quarry. </p>
<p class = "stat-block">After a creature is marked as the <em>preyfinder's</em> quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the <em>preyfinder</em> provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/mislead.html#mislead" >mislead</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/nondetection.html#nondetection" >nondetection</a></em>, and <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/polymorph.html#polymorph" >polymorph</a></em> spells and effects.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a <em>preyfinder</em> grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the <em>preyfinder's</em> quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the <em>preyfinder</em> (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute.

<p class = "stat-block">This heavy gold neck ring resembles a braided rope. When the wearer performs a raging song or benefits from an ally's raging song, she gains the Diehard feat for the duration of the song. In addition, she benefits from any helpful raging song or bardic performance for 1 round after the performance ends or would normally cease affecting the wearer. This does not stack with other means of prolonging the effects of a performance that has ended.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">Runic engravings adorn this charred rib bone pulled from a slain troll. When the bone is tossed up to 20 feet away, it can grow into a full-sized troll (<em>Bestiary</em> 268) under the user's control on command. The troll normally remains for 2d4 rounds, but if the user is maintaining a bardic performance when the item is activated, the duration is extended until the end of the performance. When the troll is slain or the duration ends, it turns back into a bone that then crumbles into dust.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This small sheath attaches to the wrist with a leather strap. The sheath can accommodate any single light weapon, wand, or piece of ammunition weighing no more than 5 pounds. While sheathed, the weapon is hidden in an extradimensional space and is weightless. As a swift action, the wearer can flex her wrist, ejecting the weapon into her hand. If her hand is not empty, the weapon remains sheathed. Stowing a weapon in the sheath requires a move action. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on any <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/sleightOfHand.html#sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> check to oppose the <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> check of someone observing or frisking the wearer in search of a weapon in the sheath.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Vanishing sheaths can be worn in pairs&mdash;one on each arm. A person wearing two vanishing sheaths can eject either or both weapons with a single swift action.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 6,300 gp; <strong>Slot</strong>none; <strong>CL</strong> 7th; <strong>Weight</strong> &mdash;; <strong>Aura</strong> moderate conjuration</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This whistle emits a loud, shrill note. Once per day when the user blows this whistle his mount or animal companion is instantly teleported to a safe space of the user's choice that's within 30 feet of him. The creature must be within 1 mile, and any effect that bars or hampers <em>teleportation</em> also impedes this effect. The whistle is useless unless attuned to a specific mount or animal companion; attuning the whistle is a special ritual that takes 10 minutes. The whistle can be attuned to a new mount or animal companion at will.</p>
