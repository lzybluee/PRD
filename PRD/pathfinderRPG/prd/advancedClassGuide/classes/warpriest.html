<h1>Warpriest</h1>
	<p>Capable of calling upon the power of the gods in the form of blessings and spells, warpriests blend divine magic with martial skill. They are unflinching bastions of their faith, shouting gospel as they pummel foes into submission, and never shy away from a challenge to their beliefs. While clerics might be subtle and use diplomacy to accomplish their aims, warpriests aren't above using violence whenever the situation warrants it. In many faiths, warpriests form the core of the church's martial forces&mdash;reclaiming lost relics, rescuing captured clergy, and defending the church's tenets against all challenges.</p>
	<p><strong>Role</strong>: Warpriests can serve as capable healers or spellcasters, calling upon their divine powers from the center of the fight, where their armor and martial skills are put to the test.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A warpriest's alignment must be within one step of his deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis (<em>Core Rulebook </em>166). </p>
	<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>
	<p><strong>Parent Classes</strong>: Cleric and fighter.</p>
	<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 5d6 &times; 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

<h1 id="class-skills">Class Skills</h1>
	<p>The warpriest's class skills are <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb" >Climb</a> (Str), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> (Cha), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/handleAnimal.html#handle-animal" >Handle Animal</a> (Cha), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/heal.html#heal" >Heal</a> (Wis), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (engineering) (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/profession.html#profession" >Profession</a> (Wis), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/ride.html#ride" >Ride</a> (Dex), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> (Wis), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> (Str).</p>
	<p><strong>Skill Ranks per Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.</p>

<h2 id = "class-features">Class Features</h2>
	<p>The following are the class features of the warpriest.</p>
	<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</strong>: A warpriest is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as the favored weapon of his deity, and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (except tower shields). If the warpriest worships a deity with unarmed strike as its favored weapon, the warpriest gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p>

	<p id="spells"><strong>Spells</strong>: A warpriest casts divine spells drawn from the <a href="../../indices/spelllists.html" >cleric spell list</a>. His alignment, however, can restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs (see the <a href="../../coreRulebook/classes/cleric.html#chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells" >Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells section</a>). A warpriest must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
		<p>A warpriest's highest level of spells is 6th. Cleric spells of 7th level or higher are not on the warpriest class spell list, and a warpriest cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/useMagicDevice.html#use-magic-device" >Use Magic Device</a> check) of cleric spells of 7th level or higher.</p>
		<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a warpriest must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a warpriest's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier.</p>
		<p>Like other spellcasters, a warpriest can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the table above. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score.</p>
		<p>Warpriests meditate or pray for their spells. Each warpriest must choose a time when he spends 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. A warpriest can prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

	<p id="aura"><strong>Aura (Ex)</strong>: A warpriest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura (as a cleric) corresponding to the deity's alignment (see <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectEvil.html#detect-evil" ><em>detect evil</em></a>).</p>

	<p id="blessings"><strong>Blessings (Su)</strong>: A warpriest's deity influences his alignment, the magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an alignment blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that blessing. If a warpriest isn't devoted to a particular deity, he selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM discretion. The restriction on alignment blessings still applies.</p>
		<p>Each blessing grants a minor power at 1st level and a major power at 10th level. A warpriest can call upon his blessings a number of times per day (in any combination) equal to 3 + 1/2 his warpriest level (to a maximum of 13 times per day at 20th level). Each time he calls upon any one of his blessings, it counts against his daily limit. The save DC of these blessings is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warpriest's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier.</p>
		<p>If a warpriest also has levels in a class that grants cleric domains, the blessings he chooses must match the domains selected by that class. Subject to GM discretion, the warpriest can change his previously selected blessings or domains to make all of them conform. Warpriest blessings are described at the end of this class entry.</p>

	<p id="focus-weapon"><strong>Focus Weapon</strong>: At 1st level, a warpriest receives <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#weapon-focus" >Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat (he can choose any weapon, rather than only his deity's favored weapon).</p>

	<p id="orisons"><strong>Orisons</strong>: Warpriests can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on the table above. These spells are cast as any other spell, but aren't expended when cast and can be used again.</p>

	<p id="sacred weapon"><strong>Sacred Weapon (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat; if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the warpriest hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is given on the table above; see the table below for Small and Large warpriests. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage&mdash;this decision must be declared before the attack roll is made. (If the weapon's base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn't apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that deal only energy damage.</p>
		<p>At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the warpriest has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another swift action. The warpriest can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his warpriest level, but these rounds don't need to be consecutive.</p>
		<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance a weapon to have any of the following special abilities: <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-brilliant-energy" >brilliant energy</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-defending" >defending</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-disruption" >disruption</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming" >flaming</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-frost" >frost</a></em>, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-keen" >keen</a></em>, or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-shock" >shock</a></em>. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can also add <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-anarchic" >anarchic</a></em> or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_vicious" >vicious</a></em>. If he is evil, he can also add <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-mighty-cleaving" >mighty cleaving</a></em> or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_unholy" >unholy</a></em>. If he is good, he can also add <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-ghost-touch" >ghost touch</a> </em>or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-holy" >holy</a></em>. If he is lawful, he can also add <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-axiomatic" >axiomatic</a></em> or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-merciful" >merciful</a></em>. If he is neutral (with no other alignment components), he can also add <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_spell-storing" >spell storing</a></em> or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_thundering" >thundering</a></em>. Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier (see Table 15&ndash;9 on page 469 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>). Duplicate special abilities don't stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any special abilities can be added.</p>
		<p>If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The enhancement bonus and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These benefits do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the warpriest's possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p>

	<p id="spontaneous-casting"><strong>Spontaneous Casting</strong>: A good warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that he did not prepare ahead of time. The warpriest can expend any prepared spell that isn't an orison to cast any <em>cure</em> spell of the same spell level or lower. A <em>cure</em> spell is any spell with "cure" in its name.</p>
		<p>An evil warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of an evil deity) can't convert prepared spells to <em>cure</em> spells, but can convert them to <em>inflict</em> spells. An <em>inflict</em> spell is any spell with "inflict" in its name.</p>
		<p>A warpriest who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil chooses whether he can convert spells into either <em>cure</em> spells or <em>inflict</em> spells. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. This choice also determines whether the warpriest channels positive or negative energy (see <a href="#channel-energy">Channel Energy</a>).</p>

	<p id="chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells"><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>: A warpriest cannot cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has a deity). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>

	<p id="bonus-languages"><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: A warpriest's bonus language options include Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>

	<p id="fervor"><strong>Fervor (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a warpriest can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds or harm foes. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his warpriest level + his Wisdom modifier. </p>
		<p>By expending one use of fervor, a good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) can touch a creature to heal it of 1d6 points of damage + an additional 1d6 points for every 3 warpriest levels he possesses beyond 2nd (to a maximum of 7d6 at 20th level). Using this ability is a standard action (unless the warpriest targets himself, in which case it's a swift action). Alternatively, the warpriest can use this ability to harm an undead creature, dealing the same amount of damage he would otherwise heal with a melee touch attack. Using fervor in this way is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage. This use of fervor counts as positive energy.</p>
		<p>An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) can use this ability to instead deal damage to living creatures with a melee touch attack and heal undead creatures with a touch. This use of fervor counts as negative energy.</p>
		<p>A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) uses this ability as a good warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells, or as an evil warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells. </p>
		<p>As a swift action, a warpriest can expend one use of fervor to cast any one warpriest spell he has prepared with a casting time of 1 round or shorter. When cast in this way, the spell can target only the warpriest, even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way don't require somatic components and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

	<p id="bonus-feats"><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those categorized as combat feats. The warpriest must meet the prerequisites for these feats, but he treats his warpriest level as his base attack bonus (in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and racial Hit Dice) for the purpose of qualifying for these feats. Finally, for the purposes of these feats, the warpriest can select feats that have a minimum number of fighter levels as a prerequisite, treating his warpriest level as his fighter level.</p>

	<p id="channel-energy"><strong>Channel Energy (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used for healing or to deal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a standard action that expends two uses of the warpriest's fervor and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The warpriest must present a holy (or unholy) symbol to use this ability. </p>
		<p>A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose either to heal living creatures or to deal damage to undead creatures. An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to either deal damage to living creatures or heal undead creatures. A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p>
		<p>Channeling energy affects all creatures of the chosen type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount listed in the fervor ability. A creature that takes damage from channeled energy can attempt a Will saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warpriest's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier. A creature healed by channeled energy cannot exceed its maximum hit point total&mdash;all excess healing is lost. A warpriest can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect.</p>

	<p id="sacred-armor"><strong>Sacred Armor (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance his armor (but not shields) with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). The warpriest can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
		<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance armor with any of the following special abilities: <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-energy-resistance" >energy resistance</a></em> (normal, improved, and greater), <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-fortification" >fortification</a> </em>(heavy, light, or moderate), <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-glamered" >glamered</a>, </em>or <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-spell-resistance" >spell resistance</a> </em>(13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier (see <a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#table-15-4-armor-special-abilities" >Table: Armor Special Abilities</a>). For this purpose, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-glamered" >glamered</a> </em>counts as a +1 bonus, <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-energy-resistance" >energy resistance</a></em> counts as +2, <em>improved <a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-energy-resistance" >energy resistance</a> </em>counts as +4, and <em>greater <a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-energy-resistance" >energy resistance</a></em> counts as +5. Duplicate special abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any special abilities can be added.</p>
		<p>The enhancement bonus and armor special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These benefits apply only while the warpriest is wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn.</p>
		<p>When the warpriest uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a free action by expending one use of fervor.</p>

	<p id="aspect-of-war"><strong>Aspect of War (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, the warpriest can embody an aspect of war, growing in power and martial ability. Once per day as a swift action, a warpriest can treat his level as his base attack bonus, gains DR 10/&mdash;, and can move at his full speed regardless of the armor he is wearing or his encumbrance. In addition, the blessings he calls upon during this time don't count against his daily limit. This ability lasts for 1 minute.</p>

<h2 id="ex-warpriests">Ex-Warpriests</h2>
	<p>A warpriest who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for his armor, shield, weapon proficiencies, and bonus feats. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a warpriest of that god until he atones for his deeds (see the <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/atonement.html#atonement" ><em>atonement</em></a> spell).</p>

<h2 id="blessings">Blessings</h2>
	<p>A warpriest can select any two blessings granted by his deity. The blessings a deity grants have the same names as the deity's domains. Unless otherwise noted, using a blessing is a standard action. A warpriest without a deity can select any two blessings (subject to GM discretion). If a blessing's power duplicates a spell effect, the warpriest's caster level for that power is equal to his warpriest level.</p>
	<p>Blessings that affect weapons and armor benefit anyone who wields or wears affected items, not just the warpriest. </p>

	<h3 id="air-blessing">Air Blessing</h3>
		<p id="zephyrs-gift"><strong>Zephyr's Gift (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch any one ranged weapon and enhance it with the quality of air. For 1 minute, any attacks made with the weapon take no penalties due to range. In addition, making a ranged attack with this weapon doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
		<p id="soaring-assault"><strong>Soaring Assault (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and give her the gift of flight for 1 minute (as <em>fly</em>). The ally gains a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. She gains a bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> checks equal to your level. Whenever the ally succeeds at a charge attack while flying, that attack deals an amount of additional electricity damage equal to your level.</p>

	<h3 id="animal-blessing">Animal Blessing</h3>
		<p id="animal-fury"><strong>Animal Fury (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch one ally and grant it feral features for 1 minute. The ally gains two claw attacks that each deal 1d6 points of damage if the ally is Medium or 1d4 points if it's Small, or one bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage if the ally is Medium or 1d6 points if it's Small. These are primary natural attacks that replace any similar primary natural attacks the ally might have.</p>
		<p id="animal-battle-companion"><strong>Battle Companion (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonNatureSAlly.html#summon-nature-s-ally-v" ><em>summon nature's ally V</em></a>, but with a duration of 1 minute. This ability can summon only one animal, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <em>summon nature's ally</em> spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonNatureSAlly.html#summon-nature-s-ally-ix" ><em>summon nature's ally IX</em></a> at 18th level).</p>

	<h3 id="artifice-blessing">Artifice Blessing</h3>
		<p id="crafters-wrath"><strong>Crafter's Wrath (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch one melee weapon and grant it greater power to harm and destroy crafted objects. For 1 minute, whenever this weapon deals damage to constructs or objects, it bypasses hardness and damage reduction.</p>
		<p id="transfer-magic"><strong>Transfer Magic (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can temporarily transfer a weapon special ability from one weapon to another. The bearers of each of the weapons must be willing, and you must be touching both weapons to activate this ability. You can transfer a weapon special ability with a base price modifier of +1 or +2. If you are using this ability on a double weapon, only one end of the double weapon is affected. The transfer lasts for 1 minute, after which the transferred weapon special ability automatically returns to the source weapon. You can use this ability multiple times on the same weapon or weapons. Alternatively, you can use transfer magic to move a +1 or +2 armor enhancement bonus from one touched suit of armor to another, or move a +1 or +2 armor or weapon enhancement bonus to another suit of armor or weapon.</p>

	<h3 id="chaos-blessing">Chaos Blessing</h3>
		<p id="anarchic-strike"><strong>Anarchic Strike (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a chaotic blessing. For 1 minute, this weapon glows yellow or purple and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against lawful creatures. During this time, it's treated as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This blessing's additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-anarchic" >anarchic</a></em> weapon special ability.</p>
		<p id="chaos-battle-companion"><strong>Battle Companion (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-iv" ><em>summon monster IV</em></a>, but its duration is 1 minute, and it works only on a chaotic outsider or an animal with the <a href="../../bestiary/monsterAdvancement.html#entropic-creature" >entropic creature</a> simple template. This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <em>summon monster</em> spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-ix" ><em>summon monster ix</em></a> at 20th level).</p>

	<h3 id="charm-blessing">Charm Blessing</h3>
		<p id="charming-presence"><strong>Charming Presence (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant an entrancing blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her opponents, filling them with either abject admiration or paralyzing fear. This effect functions as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/sanctuary.html#sanctuary" ><em>sanctuary</em></a>, except if the ally attacks an opponent, the effect ends for that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
		<p id="dominance-aura"><strong>Dominance Aura (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can surround yourself with a tangible aura of majesty for 1 minute. While this aura is active, once per round as a swift action you can issue a command (as the <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/command.html#command" ><em>command</em></a> spell) to one creature within 30 feet; the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or submit for 1 round.</p>

	<h3 id="community-blessing">Community Blessing</h3>
		<p id="communal-aid"><strong>Communal Aid (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it the blessing of community. For 1 minute, whenever that ally uses the aid another action, the bonus granted increases to +4. You can instead use this ability on yourself as a swift action.</p>
		<p id="fight-as-one"><strong>Fight as One (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can rally your allies to fight together. For 1 minute, whenever you make a successful melee or ranged attack against a foe, allies within 10 feet of you gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks of the same type you made against that foe&mdash;melee attacks if you made a melee attack, or ranged attacks if you made a ranged attack. If you score a critical hit, this bonus increases to +4 until the start of your next turn.</p>

	<h3 id="darkness-blessing">Darkness Blessing</h3>
		<p id="enshrouding-darkness"><strong>Enshrouding Darkness (minor)</strong>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and bestow a darkness blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes enshrouded in shadows while in combat, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). Creatures that are normally able to see in supernatural darkness ignore this concealment.</p>
		<p id="darkened-vision"><strong>Darkened Vision (major)</strong>: At 10th level, you can place a shroud of darkness around the eyes of one foe within 30 feet.
