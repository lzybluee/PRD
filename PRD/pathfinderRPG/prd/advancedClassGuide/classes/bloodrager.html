<h1>Bloodrager</h1>
	<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers' veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager's magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
	<p><strong>Role</strong>: Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager's place is on the front lines, right in his enemies' faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic. </p>
	<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
	<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>
	<p><strong>Parent Classes</strong>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
	<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 3d6 &times; 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>

	<p>The bloodrager's class skills are <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> (Dex), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb" >Climb</a> (Str), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/handleAnimal.html#handle-animal" >Handle Animal</a> (Cha), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana) (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> (Wis), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/ride.html#ride" >Ride</a> (Dex), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> (Str). </p>
	<p><strong>Skill Ranks per Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.</p>
	
<h2 id = "class-features">Class Features</h2>
	<p>The following are the class features of the bloodrager. </p>
	
	<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components. </p>
	
	<p id="bloodline"><strong>Bloodline</strong>: Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family's past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
		<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager's alignment doesn't restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn't dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
		<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character's bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
		<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. </p>
		<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&ndash;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
		<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his previous bloodline to make them conform.</p>
		
	<p id="bloodrage"><strong>Bloodrage (Su)</strong>: The bloodrager's source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/bearSEndurance.html#bear-s-endurance" ><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/bearSEndurance.html#bear-s-endurance" ><em>bear's endurance</em></a></a>) don't increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours don't need to be consecutive.</p>
		<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a>, and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/ride.html#ride" >Ride</a>) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
		<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he's fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
		<p>Bloodrage counts as the <a href="../../coreRulebook/classes/barbarian.html#rage" >barbarian's rage class feature</a> for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
		
	<p id="fast-movement"><strong>Fast Movement (Ex)</strong>: A bloodrager's base speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager's speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager's base speed.</p>
	
	<p id="uncanny-dodge"><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
		<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains <a href="#improved-uncanny-dodge">improved uncanny dodge</a> instead.</p>
		
	<p id="blood-sanctuary"><strong>Blood Sanctuary (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts. </p>

	<p id="blood-casting"><strong>Blood Casting (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can attempt concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his <a href="#spells">bloodrager spells</a>; spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>

	<p id="eschew-materials"><strong>Eschew Materials</strong>: At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>

	<p id="spells"><strong>Spells</strong>: Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the <a href="../../indices/spelllists.html" >bloodrager spell list</a>. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager's Charisma modifier.</p>
		<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the table above. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn't yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p>
		<p>The bloodrager's selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on the table above. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>

	<p id="improved-uncanny-dodge"><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
	<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>

	<p id="damage-reduction"><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>

	<p id="greater-bloodrage"><strong>Greater Bloodrage (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell's duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
		<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the <a href="../../coreRulebook/classes/barbarian.html#greater-rage" >barbarian's greater rage ability</a> for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>

	<p id="indomitable-will"><strong>Indomitable Will (Ex)</strong>: At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage. </p>

	<p id="tireless-bloodrage"><strong>Tireless Bloodrage (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
	
	<p id="mighty-bloodrage"><strong>Mighty Bloodrage (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

<h2 id="bloodrager-bloodlines">Bloodrager Bloodlines</h2>
	<p>When a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, he often takes on a physical transformation influenced by his bloodline and powered by the magic that roils within him. Unless otherwise specified, he gains the effects of his bloodline powers only while in a bloodrage; once the bloodrage ends, all powers from his bloodline immediately cease, and any physical changes the bloodrager underwent revert, restoring him to normal.</p>

<h3 id="aberrant">Aberrant</h3>
	<p>There is a taint in your blood that is both alien and bizarre. When you bloodrage, this manifests in peculiar and terrifying ways.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: Combat Reflexes, Great Fortitude, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Unarmed Strike, Iron Will.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/enlargePerson.html#enlarge-person" ><em>enlarge person</em></a> (7th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/seeInvisibility.html#see-invisibility" ><em>see invisibility</em></a> (10th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/displacement.html#displacement" ><em>displacement</em></a> (13th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blackTentacles.html#black-tentacles" ><em>black tentacles</em></a> (16th).</p>
	<p><strong>Bloodline Powers</strong>: While bloodraging, you gain the abilities and immunities of some aberrations, but show signs of your tainted heritage.</p>
	<p id="staggering-strike"><em>Staggering Strike (Su)</em>: At 1st level, when you confirm a critical hit the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. These effects stack with the Staggering Critical feat; the target must save against each effect individually. </p>
	<p id="abnormal-reach"><em>Abnormal Reach (Su)</em>: At 4th level, your limbs elongate; your reach increases by 5 feet.</p>
	<p id="aberrant-fortitude"><em>Aberrant Fortitude (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you become immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.</p>
	<p id="unusual-anatomy"><em>Unusual Anatomy (Su)</em>: At 12th level, your internal anatomy shifts and changes, giving you a 50% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack that hits you. The damage is instead rolled normally.</p>

<h3 id="abyssal">Abyssal</h3>
	<p>Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into the essence of your bloodline. While it doesn't manifest in all of your kin, in those moments when you're bloodraging, you embody its terrifying presence.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Sunder, Intimidating Prowess, Power Attack, Toughness.</p>

	<p><strong>Bloodline Powers</strong>: The power of the Abyss courses through your veins, causing horrific transformations during your bloodrage. </p>
	<p id="claws"><em>Claws (Su)</em>: At 1st level, you grow claws while bloodraging. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks each deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 (1d4 if you are Small) + your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance. At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At 12th level, these claws become <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming" >flaming</a></em> weapons, which deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a hit.</p>
	<p id="demonic-bulk"><em>Demonic Bulk (Su)</em>: At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can grow one size category larger than your base size (as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/enlargePerson.html#enlarge-person" ><em>enlarge person</em></a>) even if you aren't humanoid.</p>
	<p id="demon-resistances"><em>Demon Resistances (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, and fire. At 16th level, these resistances increase to 10.</p>

	<p id="demonic-aura"><em>Demonic Aura (Su)</em>: At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage you can exude an aura of fire. The aura is a 5-foot burst centered on you, and deals a number of points of fire damage equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier to creatures that end their turns within it.</p>
	<p id="demonic-immunities"><em>Demonic Immunities (Su)</em>: At 20th level, you're immune to electricity and poison. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging. </p>

<h3 id="arcane">Arcane</h3>

	<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: Combat Reflexes, Disruptive*, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spellbreaker*. (Your bloodrager levels count as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for any feats marked with an asterisk [*].) This stacks with any levels in fighter you have.</p>

	<p id="disruptive-bloodrage"><em>Disruptive Bloodrage (Su)</em>: At 1st level, the DC to cast spells defensively increases by 2 for enemies within your threatened area. This increase stacks with that granted by the Disruptive feat.</p>
	<p id="arcane-bloodrage"><em>Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)</em>: At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage you can choose one of the following spells and apply its effects to yourself: <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blur.html#blur" ><em>blur</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/protectionFromArrows.html#protection-from-arrows" ><em>protection from arrows</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/resistEnergy.html#resist-energy" ><em>resist energy</em></a> (choose one energy type), or <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/spiderClimb.html#spider-climb" ><em>spider climb</em></a>.

You can use these attacks of opportunity only against spellcasters in your threatened area who cast or attempt to cast defensively. The Spellbreaker feat, the caster's bane bloodrage power (see below), or some similar effect is still required to make attacks of opportunity against spellcasters who are casting defensively.

This is in addition to arcane bloodrage and greater arcane bloodrage, and otherwise works as those abilities.</p>
	<p id="caster's-bane"><em>Caster's Bane (Ex)</em>: At 20th level, spellcasters with a caster level lower than your bloodrager level always provoke attacks of opportunity from you within your threatened area, even when they cast defensively.

	<p id="angelic-attacks"><em>Angelic Attacks (Su)</em>: At 1st level, your melee attacks are considered good-aligned weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, when you deal damage with a melee attack to an evil outsider, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This additional damage stacks with effects such as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/alignWeapon.html#align-weapon" ><em>align weapon</em></a> and those granted by a weapon with the <em><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-holy" >holy</a></em> weapon special ability.</p>

<h3 id="destined">Destined</h3>
	<p>Your bloodline is destined for great things. When you bloodrage, you exude a measure of greatness that makes all but the most legendary creatures seem lesser.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: Diehard, Endurance, Improved Initiative, Intimidating Prowess, Leadership, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Focus.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/shield.html#shield" ><em>shield</em></a> (7th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blur.html#blur" ><em>blur</em></a> (10th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/protectionFromEnergy.html#protection-from-energy" ><em>protection from energy</em></a> (13th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/freedomOfMovement.html#freedom-of-movement" ><em>freedom of movement</em></a> (16th).</p>
	<p><strong>Bloodline Powers</strong>: Your future greatness grants you the might to strike your enemies in awe-inspiring ways.</p>
	<p id="destined-strike"><em>Destined Strike (Su)</em>: At 1st level, as a free action up to three times per day, you can grant yourself an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1) on one melee attack. At 12th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day.</p>

	<p id="certain-strike"><em>Certain Strike (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you may reroll an attack roll once during a bloodrage. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the GM reveals the result. You must take the second result, even if it's worse.</p>
