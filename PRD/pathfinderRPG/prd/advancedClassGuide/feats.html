<h1>Feats</h1>
<p>Feats represent special tricks and edges that characters have acquired though training, luck, or a quirk of birth. They grant abilities and benefits in certain situations.</p>

	<h2 id="types-of-feats">Types of Feats</h2>
	<p>Though most of the feats presented in this chapter are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to one or more categories of feats that share special rules. A feat's type or types appear in parentheses after the feat's name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.</p>

		<h3 id="combat-feats">Combat Feats</h3>
		<p>Brawlers, fighters, gunslingers, swashbucklers, and warpriests can select combat feats as bonus feats. Members of other classes can take combat feats, provided they meet the prerequisites.</p>

		<h3 id="panache-feats">Panache Feats</h3>
		<p>Panache feats interact with the swashbuckler's panache class ability or the panache granted by the <a href="#amateur-swashbuckler">Amateur Swashbuckler</a> feat. Swashbucklers can take panache feats as bonus feats.</p>

		<h3 id="style-feats">Style Feats</h3>
		<p>Style feats were introduced in <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat</em>. The style feats presented in this chapter are based on fighting styles more appropriate to the brawler's rough-and-tumble combat disciplines.</p>
		<p>As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style that a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until either you use a swift action to switch styles or the end of the combat encounter, whichever occurs first. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while you are in the stance of the associated style.</p>
		<p>The styles presented in this book follow, along with specific feat paths&mdash;feats that complement each style.</p>
			<p><strong>Grabbing Style</strong>: This discipline is a wrestling and grappling style that favors powerful one-handed grabs, fast repositioning of those grabbed, and the ability to move and damage one or two opponents.</p>
			<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Grabbing Style, Grabbing Drag, Grabbing Master.</p>
			<p><strong>Jabbing Style</strong>: This style favors rapid punches and kicks, typically while the fighter circles her foe. Many of these land in the same area, delivering more pain with each successive hit, or in debilitating areas of the body.</p>
			<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Jabbing Style, Jabbing Dancer, Jabbing Master.</p>
			<p><strong>Pummeling Style</strong>: Powerful and seemingly wild haymaker punches and extended kicks are the hallmark of this style. Deeply rooted in its martial philosophy is the concept that landing one mighty strike in the right area will send an opponent sprawling.</p>
			<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Pummeling Style, Pummeling Bully, Pummeling Charge.</p>

		<h3 id="teamwork-feats">Teamwork Feats</h3>
		<p>Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no benefits if the given conditions are not met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don't have those feats.</p>

		<h3 id="feats-that-grant-extra-uses">Feats that Grant Extra Uses</h3>
		<p>Feats that grant extra uses of class abilities, like Extra Channel or Extra Rage, effectively grant the affected ability a pool of additional uses each day. If you have levels in multiple classes that have the same ability (or abilities that are counted as others for the purposes of meeting feat prerequisites, like the skald's raging song counting as bardic performance), this single pool applies to all those abilities together, and doesn't grant extra uses to each one separately. You may spend this pool of uses each day on any of these abilities in whatever manner you choose.</p>
		<p>For example, if you have levels in both barbarian and bloodrager and you take the Extra Rage feat, you gain 6 extra rounds that you can either use to rage or bloodrage or split between the two. The feat does not give both an extra 6 rounds of rage and 6 rounds of bloodrage&mdash;it gives you exactly 6 rounds each day that you can use for either one of these abilities. One day, you might use 4 of these rounds for rage and 2 on bloodrage; the next day, you might use 3 on each.</p>

	<h2 id="feat-descriptions">Feat Descriptions</h2>
	<p>The feats in this book are summarized on the <a href="#advanced-class-guide-feats-table">table below</a>. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' descriptions for full details.</p>
	<p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p>
	<p><strong>Feat Name</strong>: The line that bears the feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does. </p>
	<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: This line lists a minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat can have more than one prerequisite.</p>
	<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: This benefit is what a feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated in the description.</p>
	<p><strong>Normal</strong>: This line clarifies what a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p>
	<p><strong>Special</strong>: Additional unusual facts about the feat.</p>

<h2 id="aberrant-tumor">Aberrant Tumor</h2>
<p>To the surprise of others, that strange growth on you is actually your spellcasting companion.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aberrant bloodline.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a tumor familiar, as the <a href="../ultimateMagic/spellcastingClassOptions/alchemist.html#tumor-familiar" >tumor familiar alchemist discovery</a>, with an effective alchemist level equal to the level of the class that grants your aberrant bloodline for determining the tumor familiar's abilities. If multiple classes grant you the aberrant bloodline, those class levels stack for determining your effective alchemist level.</p>

<h2 id="amateur-investigator">Amateur Investigator</h2>
<p>Your knowledge is more than plain smarts&mdash;it's inspired.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Int 13, 1 rank in at least one <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> skill, no levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Like an investigator, you have the ability to augment your <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a>, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/linguistics.html#linguistics" >Linguistics</a>, and <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> checks. You gain a pool of inspiration equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can expend one use of inspiration as a free action to add 1d6 to the result of a <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a>, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/linguistics.html#linguistics" >Linguistics</a>, or <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> check, as long as you are trained in that skill (even if you take 10 or take 20 on that check). You make this choice after the check is rolled and before the result of the roll is revealed. You can use inspiration only once per skill check. Your pool of inspiration refreshes each day, typically after you get a restful night's sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you later gain levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the <a href="#extra-inspiration">Extra Inspiration</a> feat.</p>

<h2 id="amateur-swashbuckler">Amateur Swashbuckler (Combat)</h2>
<p>Although you're not a swashbuckler, you have and can use panache.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: No levels in a class that has the panache class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level swashbuckler deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the swashbuckler's <a href="classes/swashbuckler.html#deeds" >deeds class feature</a> (you can't select <a href="classes/swashbuckler.html#opportune-parry" >opportune parry</a> and <a href="classes/swashbuckler.html#riposte" >riposte</a>). Once chosen, this deed can't be changed.</p>
<p>At the start of each day, you gain 1 panache point. Throughout the day, you can gain a number of panache points, up to a maximum equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can regain panache points as the swashbuckler's <a href="classes/swashbuckler.html#panache" >panache class feature</a>. You can spend these points to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat as well as any other deeds you have gained through feats or magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you later gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the <a href="#extra-panache">Extra Panache</a> feat.</p>

<h2 id="animal-soul">Animal Soul</h2>
<p>Your close bond with an animal allows you to ignore harmful magic that cannot affect your wild side.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Animal companion or mount class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can choose not to allow spells and effects to effect you if they would not be capable of affecting both your original creature type and the animal creature type.</p>

<h2 id="anticipate-dodge">Anticipate Dodge (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your knowledge of mobility and your attack prowess allow you to thwart elusive opponents.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dodge, Mobility; base attack bonus +7, brawler level 4th, or monk level 4th.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You automatically know whether a creature you can see has a dodge bonus to its AC. You gain up to a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a target that has a dodge bonus. This bonus cannot exceed the dodge bonus of the creature you attack.</p>

<h2 id="barroom-brawler">Barroom Brawler (Combat)</h2>
<p>You have learned how to mimic the combat tricks and forms of others.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day as a move action, you can gain the benefit of a combat feat that you do not possess for 1 minute. You must otherwise meet all of the feat's requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you have the martial flexibility class feature, this feat instead grants you one additional use per day of that ability.</p>

<h2 id="battle-cry">Battle Cry (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your shout heartens your allies and encourages them in the fight.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13; base attack bonus +5 or <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/perform.html#perform" >Perform</a> (act, oratory, or sing) 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: A number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus, you can let out a battle cry as a swift action. When you do, allies within 30 feet who can hear you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>
<p>If an ally is under the effect of this feat and fails a saving throw against a fear effect, she can choose to end the battle cry's effect on her to reroll the failed save. The ally must take the result of the reroll, even if it's lower. Each ally can use this effect only once per use of this feat.</p>

<h2 id="befuddling-strike">Befuddling Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>You know just where to strike to temporarily send your enemy into a confused stupor.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Befuddling Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll&mdash;thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. An opponent who fails this saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt to use Befuddling Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.</p>

<h2 id="believers-boon">Believer's Boon</h2>
<p>Your deity rewards you for your faithfulness and your steadfast worship.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 13, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you take this feat, choose one domain granted by your deity. You can use the 1st-level domain ability that clerics of that domain can use a number of times or rounds per day, but you can use it only once per day or 1 round per day, whichever is appropriate. Your effective cleric level in regard to this ability is 1st level. If the domain has a 1st-level ability that does not meet this specification, you cannot use it. </p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity.</p>
<p>If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/atonement.html#atonement" ><em>atonement</em></a> spell).</p>

<h2 id="believers-hands">Believer's Hands</h2>
<p>Thanks to your faith, you can heal others with a mere touch of your hand.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 13, Believer's Boon, must be lawful good, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, you can use the paladin's lay on hands ability. Your effective paladin level is equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). If you already have (or later gain) the lay on hands ability, you instead gain one extra use of lay on hands each day.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat counts as having the lay on hands ability for the purpose of qualifying for feats such as Extra Lay on Hands.</p>
<p>If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/atonement.html#atonement" ><em>atonement</em></a> spell).</p>

<h2 id="blasting-charge">Blasting Charge</h2>
<p>You funnel the power of your bloodrage into a strike capable of erupting with arcane power.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +7, ability to cast 2nd-level bloodrager spells, bloodrage class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While you are bloodraging, at the end of a charge you can expend a bloodrager spell slot as a swift action to imbue your charge attack with extra power. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell slot expended. This extra damage is force damage, and it's not multiplied in the case of a critical hit.</p>
<p>If your bloodline has a specific energy type associated with it (as the elemental or draconic bloodlines do), you can increase the damage to 1d8 points per level of the spell slot expended, and this extra damage is of that type.</p>

<h2 id="blessed-striker">Blessed Striker</h2>
<p>You attacks are augmented by the strength of your and your deity's shared alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +11, ability to cast divine spells, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: All of your attacks are treated as having whatever alignment components you and your deity share for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/atonement.html#atonement" ><em>atonement</em></a> spell).</p>

<h2 id="blooded-arcane-strike">Blooded Arcane Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>Arcane energy guides your devastating attack.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Arcane Strike, ability to cast arcane spells, bloodrage class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While you are bloodraging, you don't need to spend a swift action to use your Arcane Strike&mdash;it is always in effect. When you use this ability with Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, the bonus on damage rolls for Arcane Strike is multiplied by the number of times (two, three, or four) you roll damage dice for one of those feats.</p>

<h2 id="bookish-rogue">Bookish Rogue</h2>
<p>Thanks to your preparation, your arcane ability is more varied than most.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Minor magic rogue talent.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: By studying a spellbook for 10 minutes, you can change one spell you are able to cast using your minor magic or major magic rogue talent to one sorcerer/wizard spell of the same level contained in the spellbook. This change is permanent until you take the time to change it via this feat again.</p>

<h2 id="canny-tumble">Canny Tumble (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your acrobatic prowess distracts your foes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dodge, Mobility, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your next melee attack roll against that opponent and that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, as long as you make that attack before the start of your next turn.</p>

<h2 id="channeled-blessing">Channeled Blessing</h2>
<p>Your channeled energy can deliver a warpriest's blessing.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Blessings class feature, channel energy class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you channel energy to heal, you can instead deliver a warpriest's blessing to a single willing creature (including yourself) in the area that otherwise would have been healed by your channeled energy. The blessing must be one that requires a standard action and affects one or more creatures. If the blessing would normally affect multiple targets, you affect only a single target. The target receives the blessing in place of the healing and any other effects of the channeled energy. (This application doesn't count toward your uses of blessings per day.)</p>

<h2 id="channeling-force">Channeling Force (Combat)</h2>
<p>You distill your channeled energy into a sheen of force that surrounds your weapon for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ability to cast at least one force spell, channel energy class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to the number of dice of your channel energy. This extra damage is force damage. This benefit lasts for your next three weapon attacks or until the end of the combat encounter, whichever comes first.</p>

<h2 id="confounding-tumble-deed">Confounding Tumble Deed (Panache)</h2>
<p>You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Amateur Swashbuckler feat or panache class feature, Canny Tumble, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> 7 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn.</p>

<h2 id="coordinated-shot">Coordinated Shot (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
<p>Your ranged attacks against an opponent take advantage of your ally's positioning.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Point-Blank Shot.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: If your ally with this feat is threatening an opponent and is not providing cover to that opponent against your ranged attacks, you gain a +1 bonus on ranged attacks against that opponent. If your ally with this feat is flanking that opponent with another ally (even if that other ally doesn't have this feat), this bonus increases to +2.</p>

<h2 id="counter-reflexes">Counter Reflexes (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your opponent's advanced training in moving around you is surpassed only by your readiness for it.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Anticipate Dodge, Dodge, Mobility; base attack bonus +9, brawler level 6th, or monk level 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Opponents with the Mobility feat do not gain the dodge bonus granted by that feat when they provoke attacks of opportunity by moving out of or within your threatened area.</p>

<h2 id="counterpunch">Counterpunch (Combat)</h2>
<p>With deft reflexes, you capitalize on opponents' mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dex 18, Combat Reflexes, Improved Unarmed Strike, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +16 or brawler level 12th.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per round, when you are fighting unarmed with both hands free and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, the opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You must use an unarmed strike for this attack of opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="dazing-fist">Dazing Fist (Combat)</h2>
<p>You know just where to strike to daze your foe.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Dazing Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A foe who fails this saving throw is dazed for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Dazing Fist once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.</p>

<h2 id="disable-dweomer">Disable Dweomer</h2>
<p>You can disable a magic item, suppressing it for a short time.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device" >Disable Device</a> 5 ranks, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/useMagicDevice.html#use-magic-device" >Use Magic Device</a> 5 ranks, trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device" >Disable Device</a> to suppress the magic of a non-artifact magic item for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the suppression. Using <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device" >Disable Device</a> in this way takes 2d4 rounds, with a DC of 15 + the item's caster level.</p>

<h2 id="disarming-threat-deed">Disarming Threat Deed (Panache)</h2>
<p>Even your threats are curiously charming.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Amateur Swashbuckler or panache class feature; <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> 2 ranks, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> 2 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you succeed at an <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> check to force an opponent to act friendly toward you, you can spend 1 panache point to cause the target to regard you with indifference when the duration of the effect expires. A target influenced in this manner is unlikely to report you to authorities.</p>
<p><i>Normal</i>: An opponent forced to act friendly toward you by <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> becomes unfriendly when the duration expires, and is likely to report you to the authorities.</p>

<h2 id="disheartening-display">Disheartening Display (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your show of prowess further demoralizes others.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dazzling Display, Weapon Focus, base attack bonus +6, proficiency with chosen weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you successfully use Dazzling Display against any shaken, frightened, or panicked opponents, their fear increases by one step. An already panicked creature demoralized by this feat cowers. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again (by you or anyone else) for 24 hours.</p>

<h2 id="distracting-charge">Distracting Charge (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
<p>Your ally's charge exposes an opening you can exploit.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When your ally with this feat uses the charge action and hits, you gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target of that charge. This bonus must be used before your ally's next turn, or it is lost.</p>

<h2 id="divine-protection">Divine Protection</h2>
<p>Your deity protects you against deadly attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day as an immediate action before rolling a saving throw, you can add your Charisma modifier on that saving throw. As usual, this does not stack if you already apply your Charisma modifier to that saving throw. If you possess the charmed life class feature, you can instead apply Divine Protection's bonus after rolling the saving throw but before the result is revealed.</p>

<h2 id="draining-strike">Draining Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>With a well-aimed strike, you cause your target to become fatigued or exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Draining Strike forces a foe that was damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. An opponent who fails this saving throw is fatigued for 1 minute or until the foe is subject to any spell or effect that heals hit point damage. If you have a base attack bonus of +14 or higher, the target is exhausted for the same duration instead. You can attempt to use Draining Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.</p>

<h2 id="dual-enhancement">Dual Enhancement</h2>
<p>You can enhance two weapons, or both ends of a double weapon, with a single act.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Two-Weapon Fighting; divine bond (weapon) or sacred weapon class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use divine bond or sacred weapon to improve your weapon, you can choose to enhance two weapons or both ends of a double weapon. All weapons affected must be in hand or otherwise wielded. Any enhancement bonus you add to one of your weapons gets added to the second one at no extra cost, but weapon special abilities must be accounted for separately. For example, if you can enhance up to the equivalent of a +2 bonus, you could give both your weapons an additional +1 bonus and apply the <strong>keen</strong> weapon special ability to one of them.</p>

<h2 id="dueling-cape-deed">Dueling Cape Deed (Combat, Panache)</h2>
<p>You can use a simple cape to guard yourself and confound your foes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dodge, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/sleightOfHand.html#sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> 1 rank.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a move action, you can wrap a cape that you're wearing around your arm (removing it if necessary), and treat it as a buckler. If you are using the cape in this way, and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, as an immediate action you can spend 1 panache point to release your cape from your arm and entangle your foe with it. The foe can free itself by using a full-round action to escape or by destroying the cape; a typical cape has hardness 1 and 3 hit points. You can use this feat with items similar in shape and weight to a cape, such as a cloak or a curtain.</p>

<h2 id="energy-channel">Energy Channel</h2>
<p>You distill your channeled energy into your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Channel energy class feature; Air, Earth, Fire, or Water domain or blessing.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to twice the number of dice rolled for your channel energy. This additional damage is of an energy type determined by your domain or blessing: acid (Earth), cold (Water), electricity (Air), or fire (Fire). If you have more than one of those domains or blessings, you choose one of those damage types each time you use this ability. This effect lasts for your next three weapon attacks or until the end of the combat encounter, whichever comes first.</p>

<h2 id="esoteric-linguistics">Esoteric <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/linguistics.html#linguistics" >Linguistics</a></h2>
<p>You can decipher even the most exotic of writings, including those that contain magic.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Skill Focus (<a href="../coreRulebook/skills/linguistics.html#linguistics" >Linguistics</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can attempt a <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/linguistics.html#linguistics" >Linguistics</a> check in place of a <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/useMagicDevice.html#use-magic-device" >Use Magic Device</a> check to activate a scroll, or in place of a <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> check to identify a scroll. You must still have (or emulate) the ability score required to cast a spell of the desired level, and you cannot use <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/linguistics.html#linguistics" >Linguistics</a> on the check to emulate the required ability score.</p>

Twice per day, you can call upon the minor blessing from one or the other of your chosen blessings. This ability otherwise acts like the warpriest blessings class feature. Your effective warpriest level is the highest level that you have in the class that has the mystery or domains class feature.</p>

<h2 id="weapon-of-the-chosen">Weapon of the Chosen (Combat)</h2>
<p>The influence of your deity guides your favored weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Weapon Focus with deity's favored weapon, must worship and receive spells from a deity.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can call upon your deity to guide an attack you make with your deity's favored weapon. On your next attack in that round with that weapon, your weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or striking an incorporeal creature. If your attack misses because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance one time to see whether you actually hit.</p>

<h2 id="winters-strike">Winter's Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your attacks afflict your foes with the relentless fatigue of a winter storm.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Nature Magic or the ability to cast druid or ranger spells; Vital Strike, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nature) 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), when you use Vital Strike (or Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike), your strike saps the strength of your opponent. The creature hit must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become fatigued for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the target with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.</p>

<h2 id="wounded-paw-gambit">Wounded Paw Gambit (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
<p>Your enemy sees you as an easy mark, but doesn't notice your allies poised to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: <a href="../ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.html#broken-wing-gambit" >Broken Wing Gambit</a>, <a href="../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you use Broken Wing Gambit and an opponent attacks you as a result, each ally who has this feat and is within 30 feet of that opponent can attempt a ranged attack against it as an immediate action. The ally's ranged weapon must be in hand, loaded, and ready to be fired or thrown in order to make this attack possible.</p>
<p>An ally who has this feat and Broken Wing Gambit can instead use Broken Wing Gambit to attempt an attack of opportunity against the foe, but cannot attempt both that attack of opportunity and this ranged attack.</p>
