<h1 id = "technological-gear">Technological Gear</h1>
<p>Each piece of technological gear detailed here has a full description, including a set of abbreviated statistics. This information is organized as follows.</p>
<p><b>Price</b>: This value is the cost in gold pieces for the PCs to purchase the item&mdash;if it's available for sale. As with magic items, a technological item can be sold by PCs for half of this amount.  </p>
<p><b>Slot</b>: This is the part of the body the item must be worn on, if any. If the item's slot matches one of the existing magic item slots, wearing the item prevents the user from wearing or gaining the benefit from a magic item in the same slot.</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: This entry lists the weight of the item in pounds. </p>
<p><b>Capacity</b>: This is the maximum number of charges the item can hold.</p>
<p><b>Usage</b>: This value lists the number of charges the item consumes from its capacity each time it is activated.</p>
<p><b>Description</b>: This section describes the gear's appearance and abilities.</p>
<p><b>Construction</b>: This section describes the requirements that must be met for a character to craft the item. These requirements generally consist of having a feat and access to a <a href = "crafting.html#crafting-laboratories" >manufacturing facility</a>.</p>
<p><b>Craft</b>: This is the Craft DC required to create the item. It is also the Knowledge (engineering) DC to correctly identify the item.</p>
<p><b>Cost</b>: This amount is the cost in gold pieces to create the item. Generally, this cost is equal to half the price of the item.</p>

<h2 id = "on-signals">On Signals</h2>
<p>Some items, like chipfinders, commsets, and detonators, can remotely interact with other objects via signals. Signals have a maximum range set by the device. Furthermore, a signal cannot penetrate solid barriers well. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals at all. <a href = "#signal-booster">Signal boosters</a> and <a href = "#signal-jammer">signal jammers</a> can also affect signal range.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">An access card is a small strip of stiff plastic with a color-coded stripe on one side. Some access cards are further decorated with names or titles written in Androffan, or even photographs of long-dead crew members. An access card functions as a key&mdash;when swiped through an electronic lock (a move action), an access card unlocks any lock of its color code or a color code of a lower rating. Although access cards do not consume energy themselves, they work in only electronic locks that currently have power. Among certain societies, access cards are also used as decorations, worn as affectations, and incorporated into ceremonial regalia.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Access cards must be encoded to specific locks before they can function. Often, all of the doors in a complex are keyed to a unique set of cards that don't work on doors found in other complexes, much like a skeleton key might open all the doors in one castle but none in another. Coding an access card for specific locks requires a <a href = "gear.html#lock-coder" >lock coder</a>. Some access cards could be worth far more than the prices listed above if they're specifically encoded to locks that protect more valuable or significant contents.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">Most technological items are powered by electricity. While one can use the electricity provided by a generator, these are rare, expensive, and rarely portable. It's more common and practical to charge such items with batteries. A battery looks like a small silver disk that's etched with strange lines&mdash;some people have taken to calling batteries "silverdisks" and sometimes use them as coins. A battery contains 10 charges when full; to charge an item with a battery, one simply slips the disk-shaped device into the proper slot on the item. The battery's charge instantly fully depletes, and the item's internal capacitors fill with 10 charges as it does so. If the item had fewer than 10 open slots in its capacity, the excess charges the battery once held are lost. A battery can be kept within an object indefinitely, or it can be ejected from the object for the purposes of recharging it or storing it elsewhere without affecting the item's charge. Inserting or ejecting a battery is a move action.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Placing a battery in a generator's charging slot can recharge it. However, each time a battery is recharged, there's a 20% chance that the battery is destroyed in the process. A destroyed battery is worth only 10 gp. The bulk of "silverdisks" in circulation today are destroyed batteries; one can tell a functional battery from a destroyed one by the way the circuitry seems to shimmer slightly when reflecting light. The circuitry in a charged battery glows with a soft blue radiance equal to that of a candle.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 60,000 gp; <b>Slot</b>  none; <b>Weight</b>  95 lbs.; <b>Capacity</b>  200; <b>Usage</b> 20 charges</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A clonepod looks like a human-sized capsule with a blue window at head height and a bank of touch-sensitive screens and buttons at chest height. A small slot situated below the window can accept genetic material (fingernails, hair clippings, skin samples, and so forth). When genetic material is placed in the slot, the clonepod immediately atomizes the sample and processes the genetic information. At this point, activating the clonepod causes its interior to flood with blue biotic fluid, which is then supersaturated with a combination of proteins, nanites, and other materials. Over the course of the next 12 hours, the clonepod works nonstop to produce an exact replica of the creature from which the genetic material was harvested, as the creature was when the sample was taken. A clonepod can only duplicate a Medium or smaller creature&mdash;attempts to clone a larger creature result in a hideous, partially formed monstrosity that heaves and gasps a few times before dying.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The completed clone can remain in stasis inside the pod indefinitely as long as the seals are not broken. The clone created is alive, yet has no mind until a <a href = "gear.html#neurocam" >neurocam</a> is used to upload a mind into the clone's brain. A clone has the same Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the original body. A clone that is awoken before any mind is uploaded into it has no Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both 1.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Uploading a mind from a neurocam into a clone takes 10 minutes. If the mind belonged to the same creature that was used to grow the clone, it immediately comes back to life as if under the effects of a <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/clone.html#clone" ><i>clone</i></a> spell (including 2 negative levels or 2 points of Constitution drain)&mdash;provided the user's soul has not yet passed to the Boneyard and been judged.  It possesses the same Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of the original mind, all of that creature's skills, and most of the memories and personality of the creature (though there may be gaps or differences). A mind uploaded into a clone after its soul has been judged results in a soulless approximation of the original. Such a creature has its Charisma permanently reduced by 2 points (which cannot be restored), and has no ability to grow more powerful or gain levels (similar to a <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/simulacrum.html#simulacrum" ><i>simulacrum</i></a>).</p>

<p class = "stat-block">A cortex gun is an incredibly powerful device filled with nanites programmed for physical and mental enhancement. The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the <a href = "feats.html#technologist" >Technologist feat</a> succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the cortex gun's programming was scrambled, the nanites die without doing any harm or aid to the target.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">If the cortex gun was properly programmed to one of the six ability scores, the nanites swiftly disperse through the user's body, enhancing and augmenting that ability score over the course of several days. These augmentations are inherent bonuses, and increase the ability score by 1 every 24 hours that pass until the cortex gun's maximum bonus is reached.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A cortex gun can only function on living corporeal creatures, but a living creature with a bonus granted by a cortex gun that dies and becomes undead retains that bonus in undeath.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A cortex gun can only be used once before it becomes useless. The final total inherent bonus granted by the cortex gun, as well as its price, cost to create, and Craft DC are as follows.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">An emergency beacon is a small, pod-shaped device that emits a bright red flash from a dome on its top once every 6 seconds when activated. The beacon also transmits its location. Any device capable of receiving signals of any sort can pick up a beacon's signal, which can then be tracked back to the source with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) or Survival check. A beacon's transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, but this range is halved in forests or hills, and quartered in mountainous terrain or through water.</p>

When activated, it rapidly inflates into a tough little boat that measures 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. It can hold four Medium creatures. The raft comes with two pairs of collapsible, dense plastic oars to row with. The raft can be commanded to compact back into its portable shape at a touch of a button, as long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside. An emergency raft only consumes charges when commanded to unfold or compact.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">An emergency shelter is a small, 2-foot-long egg-shaped device that can be activated with the touch of a button (a standard action). Once activated, the shelter rapidly unfolds and inflates into a 10-foot-radius hut capable of providing shelter for up to six Medium creatures. This process takes 1 minute to complete. The shelter includes pneumatic spike anchors that can attach it to any ground cover of hardness 8 or less. Several windows allow those inside to see outside. The interior contains several fluorescent lights. The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, and provides excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and purifies any noxious external air into breathable air. The hut has fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and acid resistance 10. The dense plastic walls have hardness 8 and 10 hit points. The hut cannot float on water. The door is self-sealing, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease for as long as the power holds out. As long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside an emergency shelter, it can be commanded at the touch of a button to compact back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute. After this point, the device consumes 1 charge over the course of 8 hours resetting its internal structure, limiting its deployment to 3 times a day at most.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This cylindrical device has a nozzle at one end and a handle on one side. When activated as a standard action, a fire extinguisher creates a 15-foot cone of misty vapor that swiftly extinguishes fires within its area of effect. Against magical fire effects, such as those created by a <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/wallOfFire.html#wall-of-fire" ><i>wall of fire</i></a> or similar spell, the fire extinguisher only extinguishes the part of the larger effect its vapors directly contact. Continual magic flames, such as those of a <i>flaming</i> weapon or fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds before they automatically reignite. To extinguish an instantaneous fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect, provided the source of the effect is in the extinguisher's area of effect.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast from a fire extinguisher deals 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 15 halves). A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilated&mdash;using a fire extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in slow suffocation (at the GM's discretion).</p>

<p class = "stat-block">Force fields are powered by a surprisingly light pair of slender, silvery bracelets. When activated as a standard action, dozens of tiny biofeedback needles pierce the wearer's arms to interface with the nervous system; this process is somewhat painful and the wearer must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being dazed for 1 round as the force field is activated. Once active, the device generates an invisible and intangible field of force around the target. The force field blocks solids and liquids, but not gases or light (including laser beams). The user of a force field can still breathe, but she cannot eat or drink.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Activating a force field is a standard action that consumes 1 charge, after which point the field consumes 1 additional charge every minute it remains active. While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours. Force fields are automatically reduced to 0 hp by disintegration effects. A force field can be deactivated as a free action.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The charge capacity, amount of temporary hit points granted, and rate of fast healing these temporary hit points have varies according to the force field's color code, as detailed below.</p>

An unattended generator's hologram cannot leave its imagery, but it can be mobile in that area.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Green Hologram Generator</b>: A green hologram generator functions as a gray one, except that it can incorporate sound as well, with all appropriate sound coming from the image.

<p class = "stat-block"><b>Prismatic Hologram Generator</b>: A prismatic hologram generator functions as an orange one. As long as only one image is created, the image is further enhanced by graviton fields, which give it the ability to interact with the environment. (Such images still last for only 4 minutes.) A barrier generated by a prismatic hologram generator has hardness 10 and 50 hit points (break DC 28). A creature generated in this manner can be directed to attack targets. The creature can make only one attack per round regardless of its appearance, attacking at the wielder's base attack bonus modified by the wielder's Intelligence score. On a successful hit, the hologram deals 2d6+6 points of force damage, regardless of the hologram's size.</p>

If the belt has insufficient charges to reduce the entire amount of damage, the damage is not reduced for the excess dice. Damage from landing on hazardous objects such as spikes is not reduced.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">Ion tape is a ribbon of material tightly wound around a spindle. A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zip stick), the tape bonds together into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 30 hit points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many&mdash;it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.</p>

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An <a href = "gear.html#e-pick" >e-pick</a> can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

On the primary setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect determined by its color&mdash;these effects mimic specific restorative spells as indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound ability can be healed).</p>

<p class = "stat-block">A neurocam consists of a strange helmet covered in flashing lights and adjustable straps with an intricate blinder that covers the eyes. This device is used to make a duplicate of a creature's mind, copying and storing all the knowledge, memories, and personality of a living creature. A neurocam can be adjusted to fit the head of any creature of size Tiny to Large. A neurocam interfaces with the subject's brain via a modulated beam of light that is transmitted through the optic nerves and several fine sensors that must press against the user's skull. Storing a person's mind takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted use; any interruption scrambles the pattern and ruins the neurocam. This process does not harm the target. An unwilling subject can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to resist a neurocam; if the subject is successful, the neurocam's contents are scrambled and the device is ruined.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A neurocam can store only one personality. Once used, it cannot store another even after the contents are uploaded elsewhere.

<p class = "stat-block">A tracker chip appears to be a bit of metal the size of a small fingernail. Before a tracker chip activates, it must be implanted in a living creature just under the skin. This procedure takes 1 minute to perform. As part of the installation process, the installer attempts a Heal check, the result of which is the DC of noticing the implant. Once a chip is implanted, its ingenious bioelectric circuits are powered by nerve impulses in the implanted creature's body.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Noticing an implanted tracker chip requires a full-round action to search the target creature and a successful Perception check equal to 10 + the result of the Heal check used to implant the chip. Extracting an installed tracker chip is a standard action that requires a slashing weapon or tool and deals 1 point of damage. Once installed, the tracker chip emits a signal that can be detected by any chipfinder in range. If removed from a body or its host dies, an activated tracked chip retains enough of a charge to continue to be detected by a chipfinder for 1 week.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This small box of emergency medical gear can be used to augment a creature's Heal skill to allow for enhanced healing. A full trauma pack has enough supplies to be used 5 times before it is depleted. When using a trauma pack to provide healing, attempt a DC 15 Heal check as a standard action. If he succeeds, the pack provides 1d8+1 points of healing. For every 5 points by which the Heal check's result exceeds the DC, it provides an additional 1d8+1 points of healing.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">A veemod ("vision enhancement module") is a narrow crystalline strip that slots into a set of veemod goggles to enhance the goggles' use. Inserting a veemod into a pair of goggles is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Veemods are color-coded items, and provide the following benefits.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Brown Veemod</b>: This veemod darkens the goggles' lenses, providing a +1 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against bright light effects that cause dazzling or blindness. When worn, they also allow creatures impacted by light blindness or light sensitivity to see normally in areas of bright light. </p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Black Veemod</b>: A black veemod enhances vision, and by blinking twice rapidly, the wearer can magnify what she's seeing. Blinking twice again restores normal vision. This grants a +2 competence bonus on all Perception checks.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>White Veemod</b>: This veemod is similar to a black veemod, except that magnification is much stronger, granting a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Gray Veemod</b>: This veemod grants low-light vision.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Green Veemod</b>: This veemod magnifies vision even more than a white veemod, granting a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Red Veemod</b>: This veemod grants darkvision to a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Blue Veemod</b>: This veemod dramatically extends the scope of peripheral vision, granting the effects of all-around vision&mdash;the wearer cannot be flanked.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Orange Veemod</b>: The wearer can see in darkness of any kind, including magical darkness.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Prismatic Veemod</b>: This veemod allows the user to see through solid objects. Vision range is 20 feet, with the wearer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 20 feet of cloth, wood, or similar animal or vegetable material. It can see through up to 10 feet of stone and some metals. It can see through up to 10 inches of iron, steel, copper, brass, or similar metals. It cannot see through lead, gold, platinum, plutonium, or skymetals at all. It's possible to scan an area of up to 100 square feet in 1 round. Secret compartments are 90% likely to be located by x-ray scanning.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">These goggles come in a variety of colors and shapes, but most are sleek and streamlined in appearance. The primary use for these goggles is to enhance vision via the application of a "vision enhancement module," or "veemod." A pair of veemod goggles can be fitted with only one veemod at a time; attaching a veemod is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Veemod goggles consume charges only when a veemod is installed. The rate at which a veemod uses charges depends on the veemod installed.</p>
