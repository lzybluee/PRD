				<h1 id="magus">Magus</h1>
				
				
				<p>A master of arcane magic fused with more conventional weapon attacks, the magus typically seeks balance in both approaches. Many of the archetypes and new magus arcana presented in this section supplement those magi who favor their feats of arms over raw spellcasting power. More so than other magi, these combat-oriented arcanists use their magical arts to empower their weapon attacks and defenses. </p>
				<h2 id="magus-arcana">Magus Arcana</h2>
				<p>As he gains levels, a magus masters arcane secrets that supplement his magical and martial attacks. Any magus who meets the prerequisites listed in a magus arcana's description can select that arcana. Unless specifically noted in a magus arcana's description, a magus cannot select a particular magus arcana more than once. Magus arcana that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the magus spell list unless otherwise noted in their descriptions. </p>
				<p id="accurate-strike"><i>Accurate Strike (Ex)</i>: The magus can expend 2 points from his arcane pool as a swift action to resolve all of his melee weapon attacks until the end of his turn as melee touch attacks. The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
				<p id="arcane-cloak"><i>Arcane Cloak (Su)</i>: The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to add his Intelligence bonus to <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth"  >Stealth</a> checks and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff"  >Bluff</a> checks to create a diversion in order to hide. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.</p>
				<p id="arcane-edge"><i>Arcane Edge (Su)</i>: The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate action after hitting a target with a slashing or piercing weapon in order to deal an amount of bleed damage equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0). The magus must be at least 9th level before he selects this arcana.</p>
				<p id="arcane-redoubt"><i>Arcane Redoubt (Su)</i>: As a swift action, the magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to treat his shield bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonus) as a bonus to touch AC until the beginning of his next turn.</p>
				<p id="arcane-redoubt,-greater"><i>Arcane Redoubt, Greater (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus uses his arcane redoubt magus arcana, he may spend an additional point from his arcane pool in order to apply his shield bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonus) as a bonus on Reflex saves until the beginning of his next turn. If he is targeted with an effect requiring a Reflex save while using this power, he may spend 2 points from his arcane pool as an immediate action to grant himself evasion, or 4 points to grant himself improved evasion. The magus must have the arcane redoubt magus arcana and be at least 12th level to select this magus arcana.</p>
				<p id="bane-blade"><i>Bane Blade (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he may spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add the <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-bane"  >bane</a></i> special ability to the weapon. The magus must be at least 15th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
				<p id="devoted-blade"><i>Devoted Blade (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he may spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add either the <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-anarchic"  >anarchic</a></i>, <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-axiomatic"  >axiomatic</a></i>, <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-holy"  >holy</a></i>, or <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#unholy"  >unholy</a></i> special ability to the list of available options. A magus may only add one of these abilities if it matches his own alignment. The magus must be at least 12th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
				<p id="disruptive"><i>Disruptive (Ex)</i>: The magus gains <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#disruptive"  >Disruptive</a> as a bonus feat. The magus must be at least 6th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
				<p id="enduring-blade"><i>Enduring Blade (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus enchants his weapon using his arcane pool, he may spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to increase the duration to 1 minute per magus level. The magus must be at least 6th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
				<p id="ghost-blade"><i>Ghost Blade (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus enchants his weapon using his arcane pool, he may spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add the <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-brilliant-energy"  >brilliant energy</a></i> and <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-ghost-touch"  >ghost touch</a></i> special abilities to the list of available options. The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
				<p id="lingering-pain"><i>Lingering Pain (Su)</i>: The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate action after hitting a target with a weapon attack. All damage from that attack (including damage from a spell cast using the spellstrike ability) is considered continuous damage for the purposes of any concentration checks made by the target prior to the beginning of the magus's next turn.</p>
				<p id="pool-strike,-arcing"><i>Pool Strike, Arcing (Su)</i>: The magus can expend 1 additional point from his arcane pool when using the pool strike arcana. If his attack hits, the magus can target a number of enemies within 15 feet equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) with a ranged touch attack as a free action.

				<h2 id="kensai-(archetype)">Kensai (Archetype)</h2>
				<p>A kensai spends his life focusing his training and meditation into a rapturous perfection of the use of a single weapon, which is usually but not always a sword, channeling his arcane might through it in a dizzying and deadly dance beyond the abilities of even the greatest of mundane warriors. </p>
				<p id="weapon-and-armor-proficiency"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A kensai is proficient in simple weapons and in a single martial or exotic melee weapon of his choice. A kensai is not proficient with armor or shields and suffers normal arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while armored.</p>

				<p id="fighter-training"><b>Fighter Training (Ex)</b>: Starting at 7th level, a kensai counts his magus level &ndash;3 as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats (if he has levels in fighter, these levels stack), but forfeits the benefit of such feats with weapons other than his favored weapon. This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p>
				<p id="iaijutsu"><b>Iaijutsu (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, a kensai applies his Intelligence modifier as well as his Dexterity modifier on initiative rolls (minimum 0). A kensai may make attacks of opportunity when flat-footed, and may draw his favored weapon as a free action as part of taking an attack of opportunity.

				<p id="critical-perfection"><b>Critical Perfection (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, a kensai adds his Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) on critical hit confirmation rolls with his favored weapon.

Even if the spell can normally affect multiple targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies the attack. </p>
				<p>At 11th level, a myrmidarch can spend a full-round action to cast a spell that includes multiple ranged touch attacks and deliver more than one using ranged attacks. The spell must have a casting time of 1 full-round action or less. This functions similarly to the base ability of ranged spellstrike, but the myrmidarch can deliver a number of attacks he could make with a full attack. Attacks beyond the first take penalties as if the myrmidarch were making a full attack. Any effects not used in the round the spell is cast are lost, as are any additional ranged touch attacks the spell would allow beyond the myrmidarch's maximum number of attacks.

				<p id="spellshield"><b>Spellshield (Su)</b>: At 7th level, as a standard action, a skirnir may store a magus spell in his shield by spending 1 point from his arcane pool per level of the spell.

This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p>
				<p id="shielded-spell-combat"><b>Shielded Spell Combat (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a skirnir gains the spell combat ability, but only when wielding his bonded shield. A skirnir may use his shield hand to perform somatic components for magus spells, forfeiting the shield's bonus to AC until the beginning of his next turn; if the bonded shield is a buckler, he retains its bonus to AC. At 14th level, he gains the benefits of improved spell combat.</p>
