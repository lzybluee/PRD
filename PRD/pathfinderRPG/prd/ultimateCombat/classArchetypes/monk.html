				<h1 id="monk">Monk</h1>
				
				
				<p>Most monks are mystic warriors, steeped in monastic traditions that fuse <i>ki</i> with martial prowess, though not all monks or monastic orders approach their mystic traditions and fighting forms in the same manner. There are even those&mdash;like the martial artist&mdash;who reject mystical traditions and seek the perfection of fighting forms without the need for <i>ki</i> mysteries. The following archetypes represent a number of ways in which monks throughout the world seek their personal and monastic forms of fighting perfection. Some, like the sensei, use their knowledge to grant wisdom to others, while the sohei and tetori represent relatively new fighting styles that surprise those who are more used to traditional monastic disciplines. </p>
				<h2 id="flowing-monk-(archetype)">Flowing Monk (Archetype)</h2>
				<p>The flowing monk is the wind and the river. He knows how the world flows, and forces his enemies to flow with it. Even the most powerful stone breaks under the graceful and persistent pressure of wind and water. </p>
				<p id="bonus-feat"><b>Bonus Feat</b>: A flowing monk replaces the normal monk bonus feats with the following: <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#agile-maneuvers"  >Agile Maneuvers</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#combat-reflexes"  >Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#deflect-arrows"  >Deflect Arrows</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#dodge"  >Dodge</a>, <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#improved-reposition-(combat)"  >Improved Reposition</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-trip"  >Improved Trip</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#nimble-moves"  >Nimble Moves</a>, and <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#weapon-finesse"  >Weapon Finesse</a>. At 6th level, the following feats are also available: <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#acrobatic-steps"  >Acrobatic Steps</a>, <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#bodyguard-(combat)"  >Bodyguard</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-disarm"  >Improved Disarm</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-feint"  >Improved Feint</a>, <i>Ki</i> Throw, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#mobility"  >Mobility</a>, <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#second-chance-(combat)"  >Second Chance</a>, and <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#sidestep-(combat)"  >Sidestep</a>. At 10th level, the following feats are added: <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#in-harm%27s-way-(combat)"  >In Harm's Way</a>, <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#repositioning-strike-(combat)"  >Repositioning Strike</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#snatch-arrows"  >Snatch Arrows</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#spring-attack"  >Spring Attack</a>, and <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#tripping-strike-(combat)"  >Tripping Strike</a>.</p>
				<p id="redirection"><b>Redirection (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk can attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver against a creature that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks him. If the combat maneuver is successful, the attacker is sickened for 1 round (Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + monk's Wisdom modifier to halve the duration), plus 1 additional round at 4th level and for every four levels afterward (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). The monk gains a +2 bonus on the reposition or trip combat maneuver check and the save DC for redirection increases by 2 if the attacker is using <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#power-attack"  >Power Attack</a> or is charging when attacking him. The benefit increases to a +4 bonus and an increase of the saving throw by 4 if both apply.</p>
				<p>At 4th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against an opponent that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks an ally with a melee attack. At 8th level, a flowing monk can make both a reposition and a trip maneuver as part of a single immediate action with this ability. At 12th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against any opponent that attacks him in melee, even if the flowing monk is not threatening the opponent who attacks him. A flowing monk can use this ability once per day per monk level, but no more than once per round. This ability replaces stunning fist. </p>
				<p id="unbalancing-counter"><b>Unbalancing Counter (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a flowing monk's attacks of opportunity render a struck creature flat-footed until the end of the flowing monk's next turn (Reflex DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level. </p>
				<p id="flowing-dodge"><b>Flowing Dodge (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a flowing monk gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each enemy adjacent to him, up to a maximum bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This ability replaces fast movement. </p>
				<p id="elusive-target"><b>Elusive Target (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk may spend 2 points from his <i>ki</i> pool to attempt a Reflex save opposed by an attacker's attack roll to halve damage from that attack. At 11th level and above, the flowing monk suffers no damage on a successful save, or half damage on a failed save. If the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack hits the new target, that creatures  takes half damage (or full damage if the attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only half damage. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body. </p>
