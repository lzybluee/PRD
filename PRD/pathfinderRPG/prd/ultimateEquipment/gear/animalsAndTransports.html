<h2>Animals, Mounts, and Related Gear</h2>
<p>The animals, mounts, and related gear in this section can be found in most large cities. Based on its location, a settlement might not have all of these animals or related gear available at a given time (as the GM deems fit).</p>
<p>The tables for this section are split up into five categories: Pets and Familiars, Guard and Hunting Animals, Farm and Work Animals, Mounts, and Animal-Related Gear. Animals that fit into more than one category appear on multiple lists.</p>

A harness is standard equipment for anyone trying to teach an animal tricks with the <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/handleAnimal.html#handle-animal"  >Handle Animal</a> skill.

<p id="barding" class="stat-block-title">Barding</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> varies; <b>Weight</b> varies</p>
<p class="stat-block">Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on the <a href="../armsAndArmor/armor.html#armor-and-shields-table" >Armor and Shields table</a>.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Armor for a horse (a Large non-humanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much (see the <a href="../armsAndArmor/armor.html#armor-for-unusual-creatures-table" >Armor for Unusual Creatures table</a>). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the price is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on the <a href="../armsAndArmor/armor.html#donning-armor-table" >Donning Armor table</a>. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than a rider, and normal saddlebags.</p>

<p class="stat-block">These Diminutive rodents are nocturnal fliers that eat insects and fruit. They rely primarily on sound to navigate rather than sight. They are absent only in desert and arctic regions. Some cultures keep bat houses near towns and villages to control insect problems.

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> varies; <b>Weight</b> varies</p>
<p class="stat-block">This secure, portable enclosure is used to hold creatures&mdash;generally animals, but a large enough cage can hold anything. Cages are made from iron, wood, or bamboo, depending on local customs and available materials. One cage holds one animal of that size, or five animals of a smaller size. The weight of the creature adds to the weight of the cage. Cages come in the following sizes: Diminutive or Fine, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, and Huge. Cages for aquatic creatures cost twice as much, and weigh four times the normal weight when filled with water.</p>
				
<p id="camel" class="stat-block-title">CAMEL</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 150 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1,500 lbs.</p>

<p class="stat-block">Considered to be the fastest nonmagical transport in cavernous underground realms, dire bats are domesticated in captivity to serve as riding animals.

<p class="stat-block"><i>Guard Dog</i>: This Small, combat-trained dog is bred for battle; breeders favor strength, a thick body, and a low center of gravity. Guard dogs are sold in most large cities and some cultures use them for sport fighting or in some armies' special infantry.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Lap Dog</i>: These tiny dogs are commonly kept as pets. They cannot be combat trained, but can serve as noisy-but-skittish watch creatures. Lap dogs have the same statistics as foxes.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Riding Dog</i>: This Medium dog is bred for carrying Small riders, and is combat trained. Breeders select dogs with strong backs, endurance, and loyal dispositions and train them for riding and combat before sale. Reputable breeders can be found in major cities.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 40 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This Tiny, long-winged hawk is a popular hunting bird among many aristocracies. Falcons are technically a subset of hawks but are considered more "noble" in many cultures. Ownership of these birds is denied to commoners in many nations with hierarchical monarchies.</p>

<p id="falconry-gauntlet" class="stat-block-title">Falconry Gauntlet</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>

<p class="stat-block">These deadly but majestic fliers are the favored aerial cavalry of many kingdoms. While griffons can be trained, some good deities consider doing so akin to enacting slavery, insisting that a griffon must come to its rider on its own free will. The price listed is for a trained griffon; free will is bought with different currency (determined by the GM). </p>
				
<p id="griffon-egg" class="stat-block-title">Griffon Egg</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 3,500 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>
