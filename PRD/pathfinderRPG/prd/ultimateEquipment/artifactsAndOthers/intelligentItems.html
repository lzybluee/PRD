<h1 id="intelligent-items">Intelligent Items</h1>
<p>Among the most miraculous of magic items are those that possess an intelligence of their own, those wondrous treasures that step beyond the realm of mere tools to true allies. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel the same way characters do and warrant being treated like NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.</p>
<p>Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores and should be treated as constructs. They often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do), and many cannot see otherwise.</p>
<p>Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner's turn in the initiative order.</p>

<h2 id="designing-an-intelligent-item">Designing an Intelligent Item</h2>
<p>All intelligent magic items possess similar properties. All must have an alignment, mental ability scores, languages, senses, and at least one other special ability. These statistics and abilities can be improved during creation, increasing the item's overall cost. Many of these abilities add to an item's Ego score. Intelligent items with high Ego scores are difficult to control and can sometimes take control of their owners, making them dangerous to possess.</p>
<p>An intelligent magic item has a base price increase of 500 gp. When determining the total value of an intelligent item, add this value to the sum of all its additional abilities's prices before adding them to the magic item's base price.</p>

<h2 id="intelligent-item-alignment">Intelligent Item Alignment</h2>
<p>Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or by implication. If you're generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon's alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.</p>
<p>Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table below) gains one negative level if he so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells). this negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might place on inappropriate wielders. items with ego scores of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. items with ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.</p>

<table id="intelligent-item-alignment-table"><caption>Intelligent Item Alignment</caption>
<thead><tr><th>d%</th><th>Alignment of Item</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>01&ndash;10</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr>
<tr><td>11&ndash;20</td><td>Chaotic neutral*</td></tr>
<tr><td>21&ndash;35</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr>
<tr><td>36&ndash;45</td><td>Neutral evil*</td></tr>
<tr><td>46&ndash;55</td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr>
<tr><td>56&ndash;70</td><td>Lawful good</td></tr>
<tr><td>71&ndash;80</td><td>Lawful neutral*</td></tr>
<tr><td>81&ndash;90</td><td>Neutral good*</td></tr>
<tr><td>91&ndash;100</td><td>Neutral</td></tr>
<tfoot><tr><td colspan="2" style="white-space: normal;">* The item can also be used by any character whose alignment corresponds to the non-neutral portion of the item's alignment.</td></tr></tfoot></table>

<h2 id="intelligent-item-ability-scores">Intelligent Item Ability Scores</h2>
<p>Intelligent magic items possess all three mental ability scores: Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each one of these ability scores begins at a value of 10, but can be increased to as high as 20. The table below shows the cost to increase one of the item's ability scores. This cost must be paid for each ability score raised above 10. For example, an intelligent magic item with a Intelligence 15, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10 would cost at least 2,400 gp more than the base item (including the 500 gp for being an intelligent item). </p>

<table id="intelligent-item-ability-scores-table"><caption>Intelligent Item Ability Scores</caption>
<thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Base Price Modifier</th><th>Ego Modifier</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>10</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>+200 gp</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>+500 gp</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>+700 gp</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>+1,000 gp</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>+1,400 gp</td><td>+2</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>+8,000 gp</td><td>+5</td></tr></table>

<h2 id="languages-spoken-by-item">Languages Spoken by Item</h2>
<p>Like a character, an intelligent item understands Common plus one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus. Choose appropriate languages, taking into account the item's origin and purposes. If the item does not possess speech, it can still read and understand the languages it knows.</p>

<h2 id="senses-and-communication">Senses and Communication</h2>
<p>Every intelligent magic item begins with the ability to see and hear within 30 feet, as well as the ability to communicate emphatically with its owner. Empathy only allows the item to encourage or discourage certain actions through urges and emotions. Additional forms of communication and better senses increase the item's cost and Ego score.</p>

<h2 id="intelligent-item-powers">Intelligent Item Powers</h2>
<p>Each intelligent item should possess at least one power, although some might possess a host of powers. To find the item's specific powers, roll on or choose from the table below. All powers function at the direction of the item, though intelligent items generally follow the wishes of their owner. Activating a power or concentrating on an active one is a standard action for the item. The caster level for these effects is equal to the item's caster level. Save DCs are based on the item's highest mental ability score.</p>

<h2 id="special-purpose-items">Special Purpose Items</h2>
<p>Some intelligent items have special purposes that guide their actions. Intelligent magic items with a special purpose gain a +2 Ego bonus. An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item. A magic item with a purpose should be treated as an individual with a goal, not a fanatical parody. For example, a purpose of "defeat/slay arcane spellcasters" doesn't mean that an intelligent  sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring an end to the rule of a sorcerer-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of "defend elves" doesn't mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help the wielder. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of "defeat/slay all" isn't just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won't rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others. </p>
<p>The table below has a number of sample purposes that a magic item might possess. If the wielder specifically ignores or goes against an intelligent item's special purpose, the item gains a +4 bonus to its Ego until the wielder cooperates. This is in addition to the +2 Ego bonus gained by items with a special purpose.</p>

<h2 id="dedicated-powers">Dedicated Powers</h2>
<p>A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This determination is always made by the item. Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated powers even if the owner is dominant (see Items Against Characters). The caster level for these effects is equal to the item's caster level. Save DCs are based on the item's highest mental ability score.</p>

<h2 id="item-ego">Item Ego</h2>
<p>Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. An item's Ego score is the sum of all of its Ego modifiers plus an additional bonus for the cost of the base magic item (excluding the cost of all of the intelligent item enhancements). An item's Ego score helps determine whether the item or the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.</p>

<h2 id="items-against-characters">Items against Characters</h2>
<p>When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, a personality conflict results&mdash;item against character. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.</p>
<p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = the item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for 1 day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on, as determined by the GM). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>
<li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>
<li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>
<li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>
<li>Magical protections and devices to safeguard the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>
<li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li>
<li>That the character relinquish the item to a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</li></ul>
<p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following:</p>
<ul><li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>
<li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>
<li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li>
<li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>
<li>Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.</li></ul>
<p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</p>
<p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are natural rivals, even with others of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with other intelligent magic items. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and such an intelligent item usually tries its best to mislead or distract its host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior. </p>
<p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters that possess them, even though they might never successfully control their possessors. They might be powerless to force their demands, but most remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and preferences.</p>

Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities.</li>
<li>When a non-demon is in possession of <i>Chomper</i>, the bag's cursed aura imparts a &ndash;1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

<p class="stat-block">This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object&mdash;though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a <i>metamagician's apprentice</i>, he or she can still wield one. </p>
<p class="stat-block">The rod can be used as a <i>+1 <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/light.html#light"  >light</a> mace</i>. On command, it transforms into a <i>+1/+1 quarterstaff</i> or back to its rod form.</p>
<p class="stat-block">A <i>metamagician's apprentice</i> knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#silent-spell"  >Silent Spell</a> and <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#empower-spell"  >Empower Spell</a>) and acts as a <i>greater metamagic rod</i> for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a <i>metamagic rod</i>) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The rod can use <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/readMagic.html#read-magic"  >read magic</a></i> and <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectMagic.html#detect-magic"  >detect magic</a></i> at will. The <i>metamagician's apprentice</i> is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/explosiveRunes.html#explosive-runes"  >explosive runes</a></i> spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge"  >Knowledge</a> skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge"  >Knowledge</a> (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills. </p>
<p class="stat-block">A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.</p>

<p class="stat-block">These <i>rings of protection +3</i> are extremely varied in form. They can be of any alignment and each has its own unique personality and proclivities.

When the ring is in pursuit of its purpose, its Ego is 10 points higher than normal.</p>

<p class="stat-block">When an <i>obsession ring</i> is engaged in action directly related to its obsession, it grants its wearer the following powers, but can choose to withhold such powers if it does not believe their uses would further its obsession. </p>
<ul><li>The ring functions as a <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/rings.html#ring-of-protection"  >ring of protection</a> +5</i>.</li>

<p class="stat-block">On command, the tentacle attacks an adjacent creature as a melee touch attack (attack bonus +8). On a successful hit, the tentacle deals 2d8 points of acid damage and the target must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 round. This paralysis is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
