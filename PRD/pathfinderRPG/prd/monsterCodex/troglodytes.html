<h1 class = "monster-header" id = "monster-codex-troglodytes">Troglodytes</h1>

<p>Troglodytes are a race of feral, violent, reptilian cave dwellers. They are relatively common in the upper reaches of the great subterranean wilderness, and have a long history of raiding the settlements of other humanoids&mdash;particularly humans&mdash;for food and slaves.</p>
<p>A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Most are dull gray or gray-green, though other variations in coloration can appear depending on habitat. Troglodytes have short, stiff ridges running from the top of the head down to the base of the spine. They reach maturity at 10 years of age and have lifespans of about 50 to 60 years, though most troglodytes perish from violence much earlier than that. Troglodytes typically form primitive tribal societies, usually dominated by a powerful chieftain or a charismatic cleric or druid. Humans are a troglodyte's favored prey, and the very scent of a human is enough to drive troglodytes into a feeding frenzy. However, troglodytes are opportunistic predators that will hunt and devour other intelligent creatures if humans are unavailable. Troglodytes are also unapologetically cannibalistic, often eating the defeated members of rival tribes and the old and infirm members of their own tribe when other forms of prey are scarce.</p>
<p>Modern troglodytes are the degenerate descendants of an incredibly ancient race of reptilian humanoids known to scholars as the xulgaths, and indeed many troglodytes continue to use that name when they refer to themselves. Though the ancient xulgaths resembled modern troglodytes in form, they were more gifted, both intellectually and magically. When the world was still young, the xulgaths erected great stone cities of towering ziggurats, twisting canals and aqueducts, and many other advanced examples of stonework and architecture. Some of these still stand today in the deepest caverns of the underworld. Though the society the xulgaths built would be considered primitive by modern standards, it far outpaced the progress other races had made. Xulgath society was ruled by a religious caste of exceptionally powerful divine spellcasters who used their supernatural gifts to dominate their lesser kin and enslave the primitive humanoid races. The xulgaths worshiped ancient and inhuman gods, most notably the dreadful qlippoth lords who ruled the Abyss before the demon lords usurped their place.</p>
<p>However, the xulgaths were slow to progress and adapt, and lost their advantage. As hard as they fought against the rising civilizations of elves, dwarves, and other humanoids, they couldn't keep up with the technological progress the others had made. The xulgaths were finally cast down by one of the earliest human civilizations. All the xulgaths had created was lost, and many of them were enslaved. Now, not only have the troglodytes failed to keep up with other races, but they have in many ways regressed from what they once were.</p>
<p>A few large settlements of unusually civilized and intelligent troglodytes do exist in the deepest reaches of the world's subterranean wilds. Ruled over by despotic tyrants, these settlements consist of great stone ziggurats and other monolithic stone structures that modern troglodytes would be incapable of engineering and building on their own. Strangely, though these realms appear to be of xulgath origin, they were ruins before the enlightened troglodytes came to live there. This suggests that the troglodytes didn't live there continuously and develop their society, but rather abandoned the settlements as their civilizations collapsed into savagery, returning only when they became enlightened once again. Home to hundreds of organized troglodytes, these settlements are typically warlike in nature. Fortunately, the surface world remains safe from these aggressive raiders since these settlements are all located deep underground and remain isolated from the surface-dwelling races by miles of subterranean wilderness.</p>
<p>Troglodytes speak Draconic, though their vocabulary is limited because of their cultural isolation and stagnation. They are also adept at conveying information through gestures, guttural noises meant to convey their emotions, and culturally ubiquitous displays of dominance. Though troglodytes keep few written records, the creation of artwork has an important place within their culture as a leisure activity and religious practice. Troglodyte cave paintings and sculptures can be entirely abstract or loosely representational, and focus on expressing the creator's emotional state&mdash;joy and pride after a successful hunt, rage at a cunning enemy, or affection for family, for example&mdash;rather than conveying a complex narrative. Many troglodyte settlements keep lit torches so the vibrant colors of their art can be seen, since darkvision shows only black and white.</p>
<p>Religion is a strong influence among troglodytes, and their clerics and druids are almost always the highest regarded members of a tribe. Most tribes are led by charismatic clerics or druids. Chieftains who are incapable of wielding divine power find themselves serving as mere mouthpieces for the most powerful religious figures in the tribe. Troglodyte worship is a disorganized affair; veneration of the tribe's chosen demon lords mainly consisting of superstitious rituals, crude carvings and drawings on cave walls, and religious stories told and retold down countless troglodyte generations. Clerics among the troglodytes typically keep religious knowledge and power for themselves, encouraging their tribemates to worship devoutly but concentrating religious authority among an elite few. Troglodyte clerics typically choose their favorite offspring as their successors, prompting the children of holy people to engage in fierce (and sometimes bloody) competition to win the favor of their parents.</p>
<p>Full statistics for troglodytes can be found in their <a href = "../bestiary/troglodyte.html" ><em>Bestiary</em> entry</a>.</p>

<h1 id = "troglodyte-new-rules">New Rules</h1>
<p>The following new rules include variant troglodytes and troglodyte-created spells.</p>

<h2 id = "troglodyte-variants">Troglodyte Variants</h2>
<p>Although most troglodytes are represented as cave-dwelling creatures, after untold millennia, several troglodyte variants have evolved from the ancient xulgath bloodline and adapted to life in different environments and climates.</p>
<p id = "enlightened-troglodytes"><strong>Enlightened Troglodytes (CR 2)</strong>: These troglodytes dwell far deeper underground than most of their kind. Less bestial than other troglodytes but just as vile, they use their intelligence to enslave more primitive races. They become experts at taming beasts to serve as mounts and sentries.</p>
<p>An enlightened troglodyte's ability scores are Str 14, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 13, and Cha 13. A typical enlightened troglodyte's skills (not counting ranks gained through class levels) are <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/handleAnimal.html#handle-animal" >Handle Animal</a> +6, <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> +5 (+9 in rocky areas), and <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> +3.</p>
<p id = "kaergath"><strong>Kaergath (CR 1/2)</strong>: Squat, warty, and diminutive, these troglodytes average just under 4 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds. Kaergaths have dull reddish-brown scales and huge, square teeth, but lack the claws of the other troglodytes. Native to the upper reaches of the subterranean wilderness underneath trackless deserts and sun-scorched badlands, kaergaths are known for their ability to burrow through sand, their expertise with the javelin, and their preference for the flesh of humanoid children.</p>
<p>Kaergaths are troglodytes with the young simple template and the ability to burrow through sand and loose earth (but not stone) at a rate of 20 feet per round. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with javelins. Kaergaths have a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage, but do not have claw attacks.</p>
<p id = "troglodyte-paragons"><strong>Troglodyte Paragons (CR 5)</strong>: Although most of the ancient xulgath race perished with the collapse of its great empire long ago, a few powerful individuals survived. These ancient troglodytes went into hiding in the deep places of the world, and though many of them perished, fled to other planes, or retreated into lichdom, a few sought refuge in magical stasis. Over the long centuries, troglodyte paragons have from time to time awakened from their magical slumber. Though some have sought out modern troglodytes in an effort to elevate them and reclaim the glory of their lost civilization, most troglodyte paragons despise their degenerate descendants. Distinguished from common troglodytes by their glowing, emerald eyes and gold-tinged scales, troglodyte paragons are long-lived, with maximum lifespans averaging 400 years. Troglodyte paragons are extremely paranoid and obsessed with self-preservation. Most troglodyte paragons have class levels in cleric or sorcerer.</p>
<p>Troglodyte paragons are Large troglodytes with 7 Hit Dice. Their natural armor bonus increases by 2, their claw attacks deal 1d8 points of damage, and their bite attacks deal 1d6 points of damage. Troglodyte paragons have the following ability scores instead of the standard troglodyte ability scores: Str 22, Dex 9, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 10, and Cha 15. They can use the following spell-like abilities: constant&mdash;<em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/arcaneSight.html#arcane-sight" >arcane sight</a></em> ; at will&mdash;<em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/hypnotism.html#hypnotism" >hypnotism</a></em>, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/speakWithAnimals.html#speak-with-animals" >speak with animals</a></em> (dinosaurs and reptiles only); 3/day&mdash;<em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/causeFear.html#cause-fear" >cause fear</a></em>, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/charmMonster.html#charm-monster" >charm monster</a></em> . Troglodyte paragons with at least 14 Hit Dice (including both racial HD and those from class levels) can also use <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/dominateMonster.html#dominate-monster" >dominate monster</a></em> once per day.

<h2 id = "troglodyte-spells">Troglodyte Spells</h2>
<p>Troglodyte spellcasters often learn the following spells.</p>

<p id = "amplify-stench" class = "stat-block-title">Amplify Stench</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 2, druid 2, oracle 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p>You amplify your natural stench special ability&mdash;its save DC increases by 2, and creatures that fail their saving throws against your stench become nauseated rather than sickened. If your stench ability normally causes a creature to become nauseated (such as with the foul stench ability), the radius of your stench doubles instead. This spell has no effect if you don't possess the stench special ability.</p>

<p id = "mark-of-the-reptile-god" class = "stat-block-title">Mark of the Reptile God</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>School</strong> transmutation (curse); <strong>Level</strong> antipaladin 4, cleric 4, inquisitor 4, oracle 4</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Duration</strong> permanent</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, you burn your handprint onto the flesh of a creature, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. The flesh around the handprint becomes rough and scaly, like the hide of a lizard. It also glows with a green radiance (shedding light as a torch) when brought within 60 feet of you. While the handprint glows, the target takes a <span class = "char-style-override-79">−</span>2 penalty to AC against your attacks and on saving throws to resist any spell you cast or spell-like ability you use.</p>
<p>Additionally, each day the target remains cursed, more and more of its flesh becomes covered in reptilian scales. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save each day or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, 1 point of which is Charisma drain instead. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by this effect is immediately transformed into a small, harmless cave lizard, as the <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/balefulPolymorph.html#baleful-polymorph" >baleful polymorph</a></em> spell.</p>
<p>As with the effects of <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/bestowCurse.html#bestow-curse" >bestow curse</a></em>, the curse inflicted by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/breakEnchantment.html#break-enchantment" >break enchantment</a></em>, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/limitedWish.html#limited-wish" >limited wish</a></em>, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/miracle.html#miracle" >miracle</a></em>, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/removeCurse.html#remove-curse" >remove curse</a></em>, or <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/wish.html#wish" >wish</a></em> spell.</p>

<p id = "swarm-of-fangs" class = "stat-block-title">Swarm of Fangs</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>School</strong> conjuration (summoning); <strong>Level</strong> druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 round</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a lizard's tooth)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Effect</strong> one swarm of animate teeth</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You summon a swarm consisting of thousands of animate, flying teeth in a 10-foot-by-10-foot cube. These fangs attack all creatures within the swarm's area. You can summon the swarm so that it shares an area with other creatures, and you can move the swarm up to 40 feet each round as a move action. If you choose not to move the swarm, it automatically moves up to 40 feet to envelop the nearest creature (including you) if it has not already done so.</p>
<p>Creatures caught inside the swarm's area of effect take 2d6 points of damage. The fangs deal damage to all creatures sharing their area when they first appear, and at the end of their movement each round.</p>

<h2 id = "troglodyte-magic-items">Troglodyte Magic Items</h2>

<p class = "stat-block">A <em>cave dweller's greataxe</em> appears to be a thin slab of stone crudely lashed to a bone haft. It's as serviceable as a metal weapon of the same type would be, and functions as a <em>+1 greataxe</em> . Once per day when the wielder of a <em>cave dweller's greataxe</em> hits a creature, the wielder can speak a command word to force the hit creature to attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it becomes slowed for 1 round. At the end of that round, the creature is no longer slowed, but it must succeed at a second saving throw or it becomes petrified for 1d4 rounds.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This fetish of bone, shed reptilian skin, and small stones can be worn around the neck to convert a creature's stench into a breath weapon. It has no benefits for a creature that doesn't have the stench special ability. While a creature wears this amulet, its stench aura is suppressed. Once per hour as a standard action, the creature can spray a brown slime from its mouth in a 30-foot cone. Any creature hit by the slime must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for the same duration. The save DC and duration are the same as those of the wearer's stench aura.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Furthermore, the floor in the cone becomes coated in the slick slime for 1 minute. This has the same effects as coating a solid surface with a <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/grease.html#grease" >grease</a></em> spell (DC 11), but doesn't require creatures to attempt saving throws if they're in the area when the cone is created&mdash;only if they move through the area.</p>

<p>Troglodyte tribes trust only their most powerful members to look after the tribe's future members. Warren guards care for all of the tribe's eggs except those that are badly flawed; the warren guards consume eggs that will not hatch or that will likely result in a weak or sickly hatchling to ensure the future strength of the tribe. Despite warren guards' usual impartiality, religious leaders in the tribe are sometimes able to arrange for preferential treatment for eggs they laid or fertilized. This stops, however, at getting a warmer position for their eggs. A leader who tries to destroy a rival's eggs by pressuring or bribing a warren guard almost invariably draws that guard's wrath. These hulking, savage troglodytes fight with only tooth and claw. They're devoted to guarding the egg clutches, and leave their warrens only if all of the eggs have been destroyed. When set loose from this obligation, warren guards are feral, uncontrolled, and extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Troglodyte tyrants come from the enlightened troglodytes who live far deeper underground than common troglodytes. Stronger, more intelligent, and longer-lived than their degenerate kin, they find it easy to assert dominance over tribes of normal troglodytes. Warlike in the extreme, tyrants are seasoned veterans of numerous military campaigns and they are expert tacticians, willing to sacrifice large numbers of troglodyte warriors to probe an enemy's strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Corrupting Bite (Su)</strong> A slaugrak's caustic saliva is infused with the corrupting power of the Abyss. Any living creature that takes acid damage from a slaugrak's bite must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution bleed damage as its blood boils and its internal organs liquefy.

<p>The taint of demonkind has long corrupted the troglodyte bloodline. Each generation a few mutant creatures marked with the taint of the Abyss are born, and fiendish deformities and stillbirths reeking of brimstone are all too common. The rapacious slaugrak is one of these fiendish mutants.</p>
<p>A slaugrak is born with an unnatural and incessant hunger for living flesh. Young slaugraks grow at an unnatural rate, reaching full and awful maturity in just 2 weeks. From birth, a slaugrak is little more than a walking collection of fangs and claws with no thought other than to slay and eat.</p>
<p>Slaugraks are sterile and solitary, holding no special love for troglodytes. A well-fed captive slaugrak might form an affectionate bond with its troglodyte keeper, but this affection merely makes the slaugrak more likely to eat its keeper last.</p>
<p>A typical slaugrak stands 12 to 14 feet tall and weighs 6,000 pounds.</p>
