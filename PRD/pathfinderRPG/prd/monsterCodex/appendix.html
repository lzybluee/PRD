<h1 id = "monster-codex-modifying-monsters">Modifying Monsters</h1>
<p>A GM can change up a monster by altering its appearance, adding a simple template, or giving it class levels. Of these options, adding class levels is the most time-consuming for busy GMs, but it also results in a monster that is truly different. To simplify that process, this book contains simple templates that add a class's key features to a creature without drastically altering all of its statistics.</p>

<h2 id = "monster-codex-simple-class-templates">Simple Class Templates</h2>
<p>Simple class templates function in much the same way as all other simple templates. They enable GMs to customize creatures by giving them the flavor and abilities of classes without the complexity of adding class levels.</p>
<p>All simple class templates have two categories of changes. The "quick rules" present a fast way to modify a creature's abilities and statistics without having to actually rebuild the stat block. The "rebuild rules" list the exact changes to make to the base stat block if you have the time to completely rebuild it, such as between sessions when you are planning the next game. The two methods result in creatures of similar (if not identical) abilities. These templates grant their respective classes' class features, which are denoted by a dagger (&dagger;). Many of these function slightly differently than the original class ability, as noted in the templates.</p>
<p><b>Spellcasting</b>: A number of these templates grant the ability to cast spells as a member of the class on which the template is based. These templates only grant spells for the three highest spell levels the creature has access to. If the creature casts all of the spells of its higher levels, you can keep the combat challenging by adding lower-level spells&mdash;denoted by a double dagger (&Dagger;)&mdash;but no more than two for any given spell level.</p>

<h3 id = "barbarian-creature">Barbarian Creature (CR +2 or +3)</h3>
<p>A barbarian creature can fly into a rage, granting it numerous bonuses in combat. It also gains additional hit points and a few valuable defensive abilities. A barbarian creature's CR increases by 3 if the creature has 10 or more HD. A barbarian creature must be chaotic.</p>
<p><b>Quick Rules</b>: +2 on all rolls based on Str; can rage<sup>&dagger;</sup> for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + its HD + its Con modifier (this functions as greater rage<sup>&dagger;</sup> if the creature has 10 or more HD); gains DR 1/&mdash; and uncanny dodge<sup>&dagger;</sup> (DR 3/&mdash; and improved uncanny dodge<sup>&dagger;</sup> if the creature has 10 or more HD).</p>
<p><b>Rebuild Rules</b>: <b>Defensive Abilities </b>uncanny dodge<sup>&dagger;</sup> (improved uncanny dodge<sup>&dagger;</sup> if the creature has 10 or more HD; <b>DR </b>1/&mdash; (3/&mdash; if the creature has 10 or more HD); <b>Special Attacks </b>rage<sup>&dagger;</sup> (can be used a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + its HD + its Con modifier, functions as the greater rage<sup>&dagger;</sup> class feature if the creature has 10 or more HD); <b>Ability Scores</b> +4 Strength.</p>

<h3 id = "bard-creature">Bard Creature (CR +1 or +2)</h3>
<p>Capable of inspiring its companions to accomplish great things, a bard creature is most effective when surrounded by allies. It also gains some limited spellcasting. A bard creature's CR increases by 2 if the creature has 10 or more HD.</p>
<p><b>Quick Rules</b>: +2 on all rolls based on Cha; can use bardic performance<sup>&dagger;</sup> for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + its HD + its Cha modifier (using its HD as its bard level to determine the bonuses and types of performance); can cast a small number of bard spells (see the Bard Spells Known table, below) using its HD as its CL and gaining two spell slots of each level for every level of spells known.</p>
<p><b>Rebuild Rules</b>: <b>Special Attacks</b> bardic performance<sup>&dagger;</sup> (can be used a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + the creature's HD + its Cha modifier, using its HD as its bard level to determine bonuses and types of performance); <b>Bard Spells</b> can cast a small number of bard spells (see the Bard Spells Known table below) using its HD as its CL and gaining two spell slots of each level for every level of spells known; <b>Ability Scores</b> +4 Charisma.</p>

<h3 id = "cleric-creature">Cleric Creature (CR +1, +2, or +3)</h3>
<p>As a conduit of divine power, a cleric creature is often viewed with great respect by its community. A cleric creature's CR increases by 2 if the creature has 7 or more HD, and it increases by 3 if the creature has 13 or more HD. A cleric creature must worship a deity (which must be determined when the template is added) and its alignment must be within one step of that deity's.</p>
