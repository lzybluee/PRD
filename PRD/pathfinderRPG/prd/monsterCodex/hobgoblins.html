<h1 class = "monster-header" id = "monster-codex-hobgoblins">Hobgoblins</h1>

<p>Among goblinkind, hobgoblins are generally considered the most civilized representatives, although the cruelty, destruction, and tyranny they perpetrate don't create a mutually beneficial society. Few species are so singularly dedicated to battle as the militaristic hobgoblins, whose entire culture and society are built around proving their martial superiority and fostering conflict wherever they go.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins possess the intelligence and sophistication their goblin cousins lack, and overcome their physical shortcomings when compared to bugbears by working efficiently in groups. Each tribe forms a small militia that raids towns and villages, an upstart army with ambitions of becoming a much greater force and sacking ever-larger settlements. Most of these roving bands of raiders are eventually rooted out by larger military and law enforcement forces or powerful parties of adventurers, but occasionally a hobgoblin commander realizes her vision of leading a large, regimented army comprising legions of hobgoblins from dozens of tribes, and marching to war against even the most militarily advanced and well-defended enemies.</p>
<p>Beyond spreading war through their own military conquests and incursions, hobgoblins also encourage other races and cultures toward more militant and war-mongering practices. Individual hobgoblins often integrate themselves into those cosmopolitan cities where they can find acceptance, almost always taking on violent jobs or assuming roles that allow them to sate their hunger for bloodshed. They might serve as intimidating enforcers for an underground crime syndicate, inspiring combatants in the bloodstained sands of the arena pit, or hired mercenaries in a military organization. In rare instances, a hobgoblin might even serve as a military strategist for a general or ruler who recognizes that the hobgoblin's innate ruthlessness and the harsh training he's received since childhood can present a unique advantage on the battlefield. In such instances, the hobgoblin advisor attempts to lead his liege ever toward war rather than away from it, even if he must lie or deceive in order to achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins are generally wary of magic, especially arcane magic (which they refer to as "elf magic"). Instead, they prefer alchemy. Like an echo of goblins' obsession with fire, hobgoblins practice destructive alchemy that focuses on thrown splash weapons.</p>
<p>Typical hobgoblins stand only a few inches shorter than the average human, but what they lack in height they make up for in natural brawn. Most hobgoblins have gray skin, which darkens to a mossy green when exposed to the sun for extended periods of time. They often wear the clothes and armor of other humanoids they have defeated in battle or otherwise subjugated, adjusting such gear to fit their long arms and short legs.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins are born live after a gestation period of 6 months. Most hobgoblins are single births, though twins are not unheard of. Hobgoblin mothers tend to their infants' needs for only a few weeks, after which the child is forcibly weaned and raised in a nursery with its peers. A hobgoblin child grows much faster than its human counterpart, and is generally able to walk, speak basic Goblin, and fend for itself at about 6 months of age. Hobgoblin youths start their martial training when only a few years old. Such harsh conditions breed hardy soldiers, and those children who don't survive are seen as the necessary cost of building a strong and efficient army.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins rarely live to old age, as their violent lifestyle generally leads to death on the field of battle. Those who survive a career of war typically retire from active duty when they reach middle age, and either assume leadership roles within the hobgoblin military or serve as political advisors to a general or warlord. Even then, the inevitable weaknesses that come with old age eventually come to the notice of hobgoblins of lower standing, who take the opportunity to usurp their elders' roles. Such coups are generally not violent, but a hobgoblin removed entirely from the sphere of war generally falls ill within a few years and dies long before his body would otherwise give out.</p>
<p>For all hobgoblins' violent and destructive tendencies, their society is a true meritocracy, albeit a harsh and dangerous one for those who fail to prove their worth. All hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or pedigree, are granted exactly as much respect and authority as they earn through their martial prowess. Hobgoblins are ambitious and driven by an overwhelming urge to fight and spread war, but those who fill roles other than strictly military positions&mdash;blacksmiths, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, stable hands, and so on&mdash;understand that even their meager tasks are vital to the functioning of the larger army. Those hobgoblins who earn positions of power and influence must continue to prove their worthiness, as the slightest signs of weakness are exploited by the next person in line, ensuring that the army and hobgoblin society as a whole are always the strongest and most efficient they can be.</p>
<p>As a race, hobgoblins have the ability to build lasting settlements and a stable culture&mdash;they simply believe it's easier and more efficient to force those weaker than themselves to tend to their needs. Viewing themselves as superior to all other humanoids (including other goblinoids), hobgoblins take members of other races as slaves; they treat such slaves cruelly and regard them as having less value than even a bent and rusted blade. Captured enemy combatants are only rarely forced to serve in a hobgoblin army, as hobgoblins prefer the loyalty of their own kind. Hobgoblins also find it easier to take cultural innovations that they find useful from subjugated races than to create their own, for why make something new when it's already there?</p>

<h2 id = "hobgoblin-archetype">Hobgoblin Archetype</h2>
<p>The following archetype is common among hobgoblin alchemists, who wish to maximize their destruction.</p>

<h3 id = "grenadier">Grenadier (Alchemist)</h3>
<p>Grenadiers train to exercise their talents in the thick of battle, even when not under the influence of their mutagens. They learn methods of combining weapon attacks with their alchemical magic, and sacrifice skill with poisons in order to become more adept at using alchemical bombs or using alchemical items in conjunction with their martial skills. As an unusual side effect of their skill at handling bombs and alchemical items with increased speed, grenadiers master the ability to drink potions, elixirs, and mutagens quickly and without exposing themselves to peril while doing so. A grenadier has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong><a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#martial-weapon-proficiency" >Martial Weapon Proficiency</a></strong>: At 1st level, a grenadier picks one martial weapon and becomes proficient in its use. This ability replaces <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#brew-potion" >Brew Potion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemical Weapon (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder, such as alchemist's fire or sneezing powder, as a move action. This action consumes the alchemical item, but transfers its effect to the weapon in question. The alchemical item takes full effect on the next creature struck by theweapon, but does not splash, spread, affect additional targets, or benefit from any other effects that specifically affect splash weapons. Any extra damage added is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after being applied if no blow is struck. Infusing a new alchemical item also removes the effect of any alchemical liquid or powder previously applied with this ability. At 6th level, a grenadier can use her alchemical weapon ability as a swift action. At 15th level, this ability becomes a free action. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Precise Bombs (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a grenadier gains the precise bombs alchemist discovery as a bonus discovery. This ability replaces poison use.</p>
<p><strong>Directed Blast (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a grenadier can detonate a bomb so that it splashes in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone starts at the alchemist and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead of 20 feet. This ability replaces swift poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Staggering Blast (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#staggering-critical" >Staggering Critical</a> feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining from previous ones. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p>

<h2 id = "hobgoblin-feats">Hobgoblin Feats</h2>
<p>Members of hobgoblin armies, as well as those members of the race who seek to spread war through influence, subterfuge, and sabotage, often take the following feats.</p>

<h3 id = "bred-commander">Bred Commander</h3>
<p>You possess a long pedigree of ruthless generals and military tacticians, and an army under your command is more difficult to rout as a result.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Hobgoblin.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: When serving as a commander using the mass combat rules presented in Chapter 4 of <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>, you can add your class level to your army's Morale checks in place of your Charisma modifier.</p>

<h3 id = "chain-challenge">Chain Challenge</h3>
<p>You feed off the rush of victory over your enemies, and channel that fervor into battle.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Challenge class feature, character level 7th.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: When the target of your challenge ability is killed or knocked unconscious, you can declare a new challenge target within 30 feet as an immediate action. This action must be taken immediately upon your initial challenge target's defeat, and you can't take it later if you are unable to act at the time. If you declare a new challenge using this feat, it doesn't count against your total daily uses of challenge. You can chain together a number of challenges beyond the first equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).</p>

<h3 id = "commander-of-goblinkind">Commander of Goblinkind</h3>
<p>You employ ruthlessness and malice to command other races of goblinoids to do your bidding.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13, hobgoblin.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: You receive a +5 competence bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (local) checks and Charisma-based skill checks regarding other goblinoids. If you have the Leadership feat, treat your leadership score as 2 higher when taking followers or a cohort with the goblinoid subtype.</p>

<h3 id = "motivated-march">Motivated March</h3>
<p>Years of forcing your slaves and soldiers to march far beyond the limits of their endurance have made you an excellent taskmaster.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: When traveling overland, you and a number of allies equal to 10 times your character level reduce the amount of nonlethal damage taken as a result of a forced march by half. Creatures benefiting from this feat can delay the fatigued effect of a forced march for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A creature that delays this effect becomes exhausted instead of fatigued when the condition takes effect.</p>

<h3 id = "spirit-of-the-corps-(combat,-teamwork)">Spirit of the Corps (Combat, Teamwork)</h3>
<p>You find inspiration in your fellow soldiers, trusting that your shared training and dedication will bring you victory on the battlefield.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you are within 10 feet of an ally benefiting from a spell or effect that grants a morale bonus on a particular type of roll, once during that effect's duration, you can apply that morale bonus on a roll you make of that type. For instance, if an ally with this feat is benefiting from <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/heroism.html#heroism" >heroism</a></em>, once during the duration of the spell you could gain a +2 morale bonus on one saving throw, attack roll, or skill check. You can use this feat only once per round, and only once per spell or effect.</p>

<h3 id = "warmonger">Warmonger</h3>
<p>You are adept at instigating wars among those you advise or antagonize.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13, hobgoblin.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> and <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> as class skills. In addition, you receive a +4 competence bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> and <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> skill checks when using either skill to convince another character to go to war against or attack another creature or group.</p>

<h2 id = "hobgoblin-equipment">Hobgoblin Equipment</h2>
<p>Hobgoblins tend to use equipment that aids them in battle, such as the following specialized gear designed by hobgoblin alchemists and war engineers.</p>

<p id = "alchemical-sling-bullet" class = "stat-block-title">Alchemical Sling Bullet</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 5 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Used by hobgoblin alchemists to equip their comrades, these spherical glass vials can each be filled with 1 dose of an alchemical splash weapon, allowing them to be used as ammunition for a sling. On a hit, an alchemical sling bullet shatters, affecting the target with the alchemical solution within. This deals only the splash weapon's damage (if any), not the damage a sling bullet would normally deal. This attack resolves against the target's normal AC (rather than touch AC) as with a standard sling bullet, and uses the sling's range. An alchemical sling bullet does not deal splash damage to squares adjacent to the target. If an attack roll with an alchemical sling bullet misses, the bullet and its alchemical contents are destroyed, and do not risk detonating in another square.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Filling an alchemical sling bullet is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and you must succeed at a DC 15 <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) or <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/sleightOfHand.html#sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> check to avoid spilling the alchemical item on yourself. On a failed check, the splash weapon explodes in your square as though you were targeted by the item (including any splash effects on adjacent squares).</p>

<p id = "bombchucker" class = "stat-block-title">Bombchucker</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 12 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This curved wicker basket is worn like a glove over one hand. The basket extends approximately 2 feet in a steady curve, allowing you to launch a thrown splash weapon at incredible speeds and over long distances. Using a bombchucker increases the range increment of any thrown splash weapon by 10 feet. Loading a bombchucker requires a free hand, as the hand wielding the bombchucker can't be used for any other purpose. A bombchucker doesn't get in the way of preparing and throwing a bomb created with the bomb class feature.</p>

<p id = "fervor-juice" class = "stat-block-title">Fervor Juice</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> &mdash;</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This foul-tasting alchemical concoction grants those that imbibe it ferocity for a short period of time. This functions as the universal monster rule of the same name, and lasts for 1 hour from the time you ingest the solution. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) check.</p>

<p id = "signal-rocket" class = "stat-block-title">Signal Rocket</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 100 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 3 lbs.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">You can use this rocket can deliver simple auditory and visual signals to an army from a distance. When used during mass combat, a signal rocket allows a commander to change strategy track with a higher degree of success than normal. A commander can launch a signal rocket while changing a strategy track by more than 1 step to grant his army a +5 circumstance bonus on its Morale check to implement his orders. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 15 <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) check.</p>

<p>These alchemists focus their race's penchant for fire into more productive and efficient means of destruction than mere torches or bonfires. Instead, they hone the craft of concocting bombs, mutagens, and extracts. Though they possess the means of enhancing their physical prowess, many bombardiers forgo imbibing their mutagens prior to battle, believing that increasing one's weaknesses, even for potential gain in other areas, is a tactical mistake. When the situation calls for it, however, they drink mutagens to increase their physical stamina or ranged accuracy, preferring to decrease their perception and influence before compromising their mental faculties.</p>


<h2>Hobgoblin Battle Priest</h2>
<p>Serving as spiritual leaders and sources of inspiration to the corps of a hobgoblin army, battle priests factor prominently in the hobgoblin arts of war. They tend to devote less effort toward healing and curing their allies' ailments than they do to imparting powerful effects to soldiers in preparation for battle.</p>

<p>Battle priests' augmentations to their allies' strength, stamina, precision, and speed are vital to many hobgoblin tactics, and as such the clerics often serve as trusted advisors to commanders, consulting to determine what magical support would best serve the tactical situation.</p>
<p>Like all hobgoblins, battle priests live for the adrenaline rush of open warfare, and during the heat of a skirmish they often turn their attention away from their allies&mdash;it is the task of the soldier to survive and drive his enemy before him, and a battle priest sees it as coddling weakness to tend to wounds among those soldiers not strong enough to grasp their own victory. Rather, battle priests employ their magic to debilitate their foes, channeling the wrath of their gods of war upon those who oppose them.</p>


<h2>Hobgoblin Paragon</h2>
<p>Though hobgoblins are innately drawn to combat and conflict, not all find a place as faceless members among the ranks of a military unit. Some seek to perfect their own bodies to become a one-person squadron, the pinnacle of martial mastery, and a temple to perfected technique and dedicated skill. These hobgoblins are austere, cruel, and completely confident in their ability.</p>

<p>Many hobgoblin paragons join specialized teams of fellow hobgoblins within larger armies, though they live isolated lives, apart from their regimented kin, rather than feeling a true camaraderie. A large number of them instead travel the world, participating in tournaments of martial skill, from gladiatorial arenas to competitions in distant monasteries practicing foreign techniques. Others pursue more mercenary endeavors, selling their talents to the highest bidder so long as their contract involves dishing out pain to the weak or the unworthy. Whether as lone bodyguards of corrupt merchants or politicians, or high-ranking enforcers of the criminal underworld, a hobgoblin paragon willing to serve a well-paying master has no trouble finding employment wherever she might seek it.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Stampede (Ex)</strong> A stampede occurs if three or more creatures with stampede make a trample attack while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, the creatures can trample foes of their size or smaller, and the trample's save DC increases by +2.</p>

<p>An yzobu is a herd animal found in cold hills, plains, and mountains. It stands roughly the height of a horse, but has a bulkier frame. Its head is more bovine, with a pair of thick, slightly curved horns protruding from the sides of its flat forehead and four smaller prongs jutting from the top. The fur of an yzobu is long and shaggy, protecting it from the harsh winters of its habitat. This pelt accumulates a pungent secretion from the yzobu's body that gives it a strong odor that those unaccustomed to the creatures find sickening.</p>
<p>Like the hobgoblins who use them as mounts and beasts of burden, yzobus (called "battle yaks" by their war-mongering handlers) live in complex social groups. These immense herds can number in the thousands, and present quite a problem to ranchers, explorers, and pioneers who encounter them while traversing the open plains and hills where the yzobus graze. A single herd can range over a spread of tens of thousands of square miles in a year, devouring all the grass and small vegetation in the region, trampling what they can't eat, and forcing other creatures&mdash;including humanoids&mdash;to move elsewhere or suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>Yzobus are extremely aggressive, and fight ruthlessly to defend even the weakest member of their herd, making them difficult pests to deal with, and even more difficult to train for service or war. Hobgoblins have grown skilled at the process, and keep a fair number of tamed yzobus. They breed these with wild yzobus every few generations to keep them fierce.</p>
