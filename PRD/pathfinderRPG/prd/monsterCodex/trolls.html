<h1 class = "monster-header" id = "monster-codex-trolls">Trolls</h1>

<p>If folk tales are to be believed, trolls are solitary brutes who empty the wildlands of prey, then rampage through border villages and far-flung homesteads, eating livestock and defenders alike and moving on only when the food runs out or defenders chase them off with flame. But rangers, druids, and other seasoned adventurers know that these isolated trolls are not the whole story. Deep in the wilderness, trolls live in traveling families led by ruthlessly pragmatic females, hunting the forests and fens in carefully managed patterns to avoid exhausting the land's bounty.</p>
<p>While it's true that trolls are generally dangerous, selfish, and wicked monsters, troll culture and society are a strange and complicated jumble of contradictions. Trolls care for their young, and viciously kill or exile any who threaten the tribe's survival. Those who are exiled tend to become even more dangerous to both the tribal unit and creatures outside the tribe, as they grow more daring and ravenous, treating any creature as prey, including other trolls. When such exiles make their way into more populated areas, their destructive exploits give rise to the tales commonly told about trolls. Trolls who work together are more cautious and likely to avoid civilization, but can still be an organized storm of carnage in unified hunts and raids. And when many tribes can unify under a troll monarch, the ground shakes with thundering troll feet and every scrap of edible material is torn up and gulped down to fill their bellies. Fortunately, such gatherings of trolls are rare affairs that often burn themselves out through infighting, the passing of the threat that united them, or eventual over-hunting.</p>
<p>Trolls average 14 feet tall when standing upright, but seem no more than 8 feet tall because they hunch forward, perpetually on the verge of knuckle-walking. They generally have greenish skin, matted hair, large tusks protruding from their lower jaws, and inky-black eyes. Several kinds of troll variants also possess adaptations to different environments (such as wintry lands, deep caves, and oceans). Trolls of different types typically do not feel any close kinship to one another.</p>
<p>A troll's greatest motivation is its constant, gnawing hunger. An adult troll needs to eat the equivalent of a large pig every day just to fuel its demanding metabolism. This constant consumption powers the ability that sets trolls apart from other giants: the effortless regeneration of damaged tissue. A troll can reattach its severed limbs or grow new ones within minutes, and even a hacked-apart troll can restore itself, given enough time. Since under ordinary circumstances trolls cannot die from injury, they are fearless in battle, aggressively attacking without fearing loss of life or limb. Trolls are well aware of the few ways in which they can be killed, but even when confronted by the possibility of death, they have a hard time comprehending that it could really happen to them.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to kill a troll as long as its regeneration is in effect, but there are several ways to temporarily impede the regeneration long enough for a troll to die, or to kill it via means other than direct physical damage. A troll who doesn't get enough to eat over the course of a few days loses its regeneration and becomes vulnerable, though a single adequate meal will bring it back into fighting trim, and starvation itself is a common cause of death for trolls. Drowning a troll is also effective. The two most common ways to negate a troll's regeneration, however, are fire and acid, both of which create horrible wounds that damage the flesh beyond the power of regeneration to repair. Burning the stumps and corpse of an unconscious troll is the best way to permanently kill the creature.</p>
<p>Female trolls are significantly larger than males and slightly more intelligent. Male trolls are usually solitary; female trolls are much more social, banding together into nomadic groups of two to four plus younglings. Female trolls are highly protective of their young and run off any male trolls who overstay their welcome as well as any other creatures that might pose a threat. However, female trolls turn a blind eye to the vicious fighting between young trolls, viewing it as a necessary part of toughening them up for adult life.</p>
<p>Sometimes an elder female troll who has mastered the magic arts will temporarily join a group to observe and test the female young for magical aptitude, often staying with the group until a promising juvenile reaches maturity, protecting her from the worst of the fighting if her strengths don't lie in that direction. Once the juvenile is mature enough to leave her group, she is trained in the ways of magic.</p>
<p>Unlike females, most male trolls spend much of their lives alone. At maturity they either leave on their own or are run off by the adult females. A solitary male usually finds a large territory that it uses as a hunting ground, building a lair in the center and driving off any other trolls or other monsters. Males usually leave their territory only to mate, and often woo by attempting to best other suitors in combat.</p>
<p>Trolls have simple religious beliefs; they usually revere a demon lord of storms and natural disasters. Priests of this faith use acid and fire to intentionally burn and mutilate themselves, leaving them with horrific disfiguring scars.</p>
<p>Trolls generally live in wilderness regions with heavy forests or rocky terrain where it's easier for them to surprise their prey. They try to maintain a distance between themselves and other major predators and intelligent creatures. Troll druids, known as troll furies, mind the health of an entire region and are always the first to realize emerging dangers from encroaching ogres, humans, or other outside forces.</p>
<p>Full statistics for trolls can be found in their <a href = "../bestiary/troll.html" ><em>Bestiary</em> entry</a>.</p>

<h1 id = "troll-new-rules">New Rules</h1>
<p>Trolls are known primarily for their dangerous natural attacks and regenerative abilities. Most of the new troll options presented here complement these racial abilities.</p>

<h2 id = "troll-archetype">Troll Archetype</h2>
<p>The following archetype is available to trolls.</p>

<h3 id = "troll-fury">Troll Fury (Druid)</h3>
<p>Troll furies combine a druid's love of natural balance with a single-minded devotion to the welfare of the troll tribe. Trolls require a lot of prey to keep fed, and if their hunting grounds are upset by incursions of other monsters, civilized deforestation, or careless trolls who eat more than they need, a troll tribe can find itself without a sustainable food source.</p>
<p>Troll furies take the long view on sustainability, protecting the trolls' territory from gluttonous trolls and outsiders alike, and even hunting down tribal enemies when necessary. Holding themselves aloof from the rest of troll society, troll furies command great respect and can rally a region's trolls quickly to deal with threats to their existence and the health of their environment.</p>
<p id = "inspire-fervor"><strong>Inspire Fervor (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, once per day as a standard action, a troll fury can chant over another troll within 30 feet, bolstering it against fear and improving its combat abilities. This works like the inspire courage bard ability, but affects only one troll and lasts 1 minute. The troll fury uses her druid level as her bard level to determine the effects of this ability. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
<p id = "chosen-prey"><strong>Chosen Prey (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a troll fury can select one creature type from the ranger's favored enemy list and gains a favored enemy bonus against that creature type with an effective ranger level equal to her druid level. This ability never grants the troll fury favored enemy bonuses against a second favored enemy creature type. A troll fury can change her favored enemy type once per week by performing a ritual that takes 1 hour to perform. If a troll fury already has a favored enemy from another class, the levels from the classes that grant favored enemies stack with this one to determine the favored enemy bonuses, and in this case she can gain other favored enemy creature types. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>
<p id = "troll-fury's-mark"><strong>Troll Fury's Mark (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, each time a troll fury or her animal companion damages a creature with a natural attack, the troll fury gains a +10 insight bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> checks to track that creature for 24 hours. The duration of this ability does not stack with itself. Each time the troll fury or her animal companion hits the target, this ability lasts for the next 24 hours. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>

<h2 id = "troll-feats">Troll Feats</h2>
<p>The following feats are available to trolls.</p>

<h3 id = "cooperative-rend">Cooperative Rend (Combat, Teamwork)</h3>
<p>You and an ally each sink a claw into your foe&mdash;then all you have to do is pull.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Rend, troll.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you and an ally who has this feat are both threatening the same creature, you must hit the target with at least one of your claw attacks to use your rend ability.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Normal</strong>: You must hit with two of your claw attacks to use your rend ability.</p>

<h3 id = "great-rend">Great Rend (Combat)</h3>
<p>You use your teeth and claws to rip your foes to shreds.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Bite attack, rend, troll.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you are able to use your rend ability on the same turn that you also succeed at a bite attack, your rend deals an amount of additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier.</p>

<h3 id = "mighty-bite">Mighty Bite (Combat)</h3>
<p>Your rending claws expose your opponent's vital organs to your teeth.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +6, bite attack, rend, troll.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you deal damage to a creature with your rend ability, the critical threat range of your bite attack becomes 18&ndash;20 until the start of your next turn. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase your bite's critical threat range (such as the <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-keen" >keen</a></em> weapon special ability or the <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-critical" >Improved Critical</a> feat).</p>

<h3 id = "raging-regeneration">Raging Regeneration (Combat)</h3>
<p>Your rage pushes your ability to regenerate beyond its normal limits.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Rage class ability, regeneration, troll.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: While you are raging, fire and acid damage don't make your regeneration stop functioning on the round following the attack, and instead reduce the number of hit points regained by regeneration each round by 2 until the end of your next turn.<span class = "char-style-override-11"> </span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Normal</strong>: Acid and fire damage cause your regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack.</p>

<h3 id = "regenerate-muscles">Regenerate Muscles</h3>
<p>You use your powerful metabolism to temporarily increase the strength of your muscles, but doing so costs you your regeneration powers.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#power-attack" >Power Attack</a>, regeneration, troll.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a free action, you can make your regeneration stop working for 1 minute and gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Strength. You lose your regeneration ability while you benefit from this bonus to Strength and for 1 minute afterward. You can end this ability early as a free action. You can activate this ability only if your regeneration is functioning.</p>

<h3 id = "sprinting-troll">Sprinting Troll</h3>
<p>You use your powerful metabolism to hunt swiftly, starving your regenerative powers in the interest of granting yourself greater speed.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#fleet" >Fleet</a>, regeneration, troll.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a free action, you can increase your land speed by 10 feet for 1 minute. You lose your regeneration ability while you benefit from this enhancement bonus to your land speed and for 1 minute afterward. You can end this ability early as a free action. You can activate this ability only if your regeneration is functioning.</p>

<h2 id = "troll-equipment">Troll Equipment</h2>
<p>The following piece of equipment is intended for trolls, but similar items can be crafted for other clawed creatures with only minor alterations.</p>

<p id = "barbed-troll-claws" class = "stat-block-title">Barbed Troll Claws</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 4 lbs.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">These metal sheaths slide onto the claws of a troll. When a troll hits with a claw attack while wearing the sheaths, it can either keep the sheaths on its hand (in which case the claw attack deals 1 extra point of damage) or allow the four sheaths on that hand to slide off and become embedded in the wound (in which case the claw attack deals 1 point of bleed damage). The listed price is for a set of 8 sheaths (one for each claw on both of a troll's four-fingered hands).</p>

<h2 id = "troll-spells">Troll Spells</h2>
<p>The following spells are used almost exclusively by trolls.</p>

<p id = "transfer-regeneration" class = "stat-block-title">Transfer Regeneration</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3, druid 3, shaman 3, witch 3</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Target</strong> 1 willing living creature</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p class = "stat-block">You bestow your regenerative abilities on the target. Your regeneration stops functioning for the duration of the spell, and the target gains your regeneration. For example, if you have regeneration 5 (acid or fire), your target gains regeneration 5 (acid or fire). This regeneration overlaps (does not stack) with any regeneration the creature already has, including other castings of this spell. This spell has no effect if you don't have the regeneration ability or your regeneration isn't functioning when you cast the spell.</p>

<p id = "trial-of-fire-and-acid" class = "stat-block-title">Trial of Fire and Acid</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>School</strong> evocation [acid, fire]; <strong>Level</strong> bloodrager 3, cleric 3, magus 3, shaman 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude half (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The target creature is covered in burning acid that deals 1d6 points of acid damage and 1d6 points of fire damage each round. The subject can attempt a Fortitude saving throw each round to reduce the damage by half. Dousing the target in water ends the effect (both the acid and the fire), but rolling on the ground does not extinguish the fire or affect the acid.</p>


<h2 id = "troll-magic-items">Troll Magic Items</h2>
<p>Rarely does a troll spellcaster take an interest in crafting magic items, but when it does, it usually creates an item that enhances trolls' natural attacks.</p>

<p id = "cloak-of-the-troll-king" class = "stat-block-title">Cloak of the Troll King</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 9,000 gp; <strong>Slot</strong> shoulders; <strong>CL</strong> 5th; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.; <strong>Aura</strong> faint evocation</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This long cloak is a patchwork of beast and humanoid hides roughly stitched together. A crude, crown-shaped patch of yellow-dyed fabric is sewn on the back, and a length of knotted hemp rope secures the cloak around the wearer's neck. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> checks and the ability to use <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/burningHands.html#burning-hands" >burning hands</a></em> as a spell-like ability three times per day.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Construction Requirements</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Cost</strong> 4,500 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Craft Wondrous Item, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/burningHands.html#burning-hands" >burning hands</a></em>, <em><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/causeFear.html#cause-fear" >cause fear</a></em> </p>

<p id = "gauntlets-of-rending" class = "stat-block-title">Gauntlets of Rending</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Price</strong> 8,000 gp; <strong>Slot</strong> hands; <strong>CL</strong> 5th; <strong>Weight</strong> 4 lbs.; <strong>Aura</strong> faint evocation</p>
<p class = "stat-block">These Large gauntlets are bulky, and the palms and fingers are studded with wickedly serrated spikes. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with its claw attacks; the wearer adds this bonus damage once for each claw attack used in a rend. The crude construction and thick metal used in the gauntlets make it difficult for the wearer to perform fine manipulation. Consequently, the wearer takes a &ndash;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based checks involving her hands.</p>

<p>A troll fury's first duty is to see to the welfare of her tribe, and to ensure its prosperity in the long term. Watching the lands around her carefully, monitoring the migration of game, and minding the lessons of her predecessors all let a troll fury anticipate times of plenty and times of need, and to stockpile or conserve as necessary. Though a troll fury never rushes into a decision that could endanger the tribe, she commands her own tribe or newcomers to their territory to move on if there's a risk that the hunting grounds will be overhunted. Wise tribes leave the area when she tells them to, but sometimes she must drive them away with fire and poison so the animals have time to repopulate.</p>
<p>To a troll fury's mind, it's wiser to risk traveling to another land in the short term so exhausted lands can recover. This attitude, combined with her knowledge of natural environments, means she's the member of the tribe most likely to lead a migration. In larger tribes, a triumvirate or larger group of furies works together. Each concentrates on a particular area of expertise, but they all back one another up once one of them makes a decision that affects the tribe. This solidarity lets them cow even the most autocratic tribal leaders.</p>

<p>A troll elder matron serves her tribe as the fount of all magical knowledge. She is both her tribemates' fiercest protector and their harshest critic, doling out punishments to those who fail to achieve the (sometimes cryptic) goals she sets for them. Female trolls benefit from a matron's teachings almost exclusively, though she might set a promising young male on the path toward becoming a ranger. The matron often lives or travels with females nearing adulthood who are struggling with their studies; those she rejects as unworthy rejoin their sisters and never speak of the strange things they experienced while apprenticed to the matron. Even a troll monarch listens to an elder matron's counsel, for she has outlived many monarchs and watched generations of trolls be born, grow, and die.</p>

<p>Most monarchs claim large territories and dominion over a dozen troll tribes within that area, but only rarely do they call these minions together into a single place, for they know that too many hungry troll bellies in close proximity means over-hunting and starvation.</p>
<p>Though female trolls control troll groups in most cases, troll monarchs may be male or female&mdash;female trolls have more access to training and more political savvy as a result of their communal upbringing, but male trolls sometimes benefit from unusual experiences gained during their years of relative isolation. Either way, would-be monarchs tell audacious lies and exaggerate their accomplishments to win followers, drawing their gullible fellows in.</p>
<p>Word spreads quickly once one becomes dominant. Wild tales make the monarch sound far more powerful than he truly is, exaggerating his size and appetite, and often claiming he is impervious to acid and fire. Troll monarchs typically add an epithet to their names, such as "the Firewalker," "the Green," or "the Many-Fanged."</p>

<p>Sewer trolls are close relations to both common trolls and scrags. They are much smaller, however, only weighing around 200 pounds and reaching up to 6 feet tall. Like normal trolls, sewer trolls possess regenerative powers that allow them to recover from almost any wound and even regrow limbs, though these powers can be thwarted by fire or acid. Their regeneration is significantly slower than a normal troll's, however.</p>
<p>Unlike the eyes of normal trolls, sewer trolls' eyes are so sensitive to light that they are momentarily blinded by bright lights. Their eyes absorb ambient light, which damages the slimy membrane that covers them. As the membrane regenerates, a strange reaction causes the eyes to glow orange.</p>
<p>In addition to being smaller than normal trolls, sewer trolls are incredibly flexible and can squeeze through small spaces with ease. When the terrain is favorable, they hunt by ambushing prey from small spaces that don't appear capable of harboring a threat.</p>
<p>Sewer trolls can eat almost anything, but prefer fresh meat, and like normal trolls they need a lot of food to power their regenerative abilities. Though they can subsist on subterranean fish, they prefer the warm blood and flesh of mammals.</p>
<p>Sewer trolls tend to lair underground in areas with a large prey population or ample sources of other nutrients. While sewer trolls are common in some of the immense caves deep underground, their name derives from their lairs under the cities of the surface world. A major city often hosts dozens of the creatures, living in small family groups or lairing on their own. They rarely leave the sewers because of their light blindness, but they have been known to hide just below sewer grates and snatch children who walk too close. In times of desperate hunger, sewer trolls may leave the sewers, invariably at night. They stick to the shadows and ambush lone walkers, or sneak through windows to snatch babies from their cribs. Sewer trolls outside of their native environment are easily scared, but woe to the unprepared foe who follows them back into the sewers.</p>
<p>Sewer trolls sometimes join groups of normal trolls or, being semiaquatic, groups of scrags, to benefit from safety in numbers. Their smaller size and weakness mean they're often bullied by their more dangerous cousins, but many sewer trolls accept this as inevitable. They typically have to do menial chores, like collecting rodents to eat if bigger game is scarce, or being the first to venture into unexplored caves, in exchange for protection.</p>
