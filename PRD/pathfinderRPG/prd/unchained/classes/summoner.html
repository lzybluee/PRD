<h1>Summoner</h1>
<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-flung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
<p><strong>Unchained</strong>: Most of the summoner's class features are the same as those of the class's original design&mdash;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon's general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>


<h1 id = "class-skills">Class Skills</h1>

<h2 id = "class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>The following are the class features of the summoner.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
<p id = "spells"><strong>Spells</strong>: A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner's spell list is different from that presented in the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
	<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner's Charisma modifier.</p>
	<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&ndash;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p>
	<p>A summoner's selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner's choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on the table below. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on the table below are fixed.)</p>
	<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
	<p>A summoner doesn't need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>

<p id = "cantrips"><strong>Cantrips</strong>: A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on the table below. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>

<p id = "eidolon"><strong>Eidolon</strong>: A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/protectionFromEvil.html#protection-from-evil" ><em>protection from evil</em></a> and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
	<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic" ><em>dispel magic</em></a>, but spells such as <em>dismissal</em> and <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/banishment.html#banishment" ><em>banishment</em></a> function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
	<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The eidolon's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner's class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner's class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
	<p>The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner's forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/alterSelf.html#alter-self" ><em>alter self</em></a> or <em>polymorph</em> (although <em>invisibility</em> does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>

<p id = "life-link"><strong>Life Link (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
	<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

<p id = "summon-monster"><strong><em>Summon Monster I (Sp)</em></strong>: At 1st level, a summoner can cast <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-i" ><em>summon monster I</em></a> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-ix" ><em>summon monster IX</em></a> at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as <em>gate</em> or <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-ix" ><em>summon monster IX</em></a>. If used as <em>gate</em>, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one <em>summon monster</em> or <em>gate</em> spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing <em>summon monster</em> or <em>gate</em> from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner's spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>

<p id = "bond-senses"><strong>Bond Senses (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

<p id = "shield-ally"><strong>Shield Ally (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>

<p id = "makers-call"><strong>Maker's Call (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/dimensionDoor.html#dimension-door" ><em>dimension door</em></a>, using the summoner's caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>

<p id = "transposition"><strong>Transposition (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker's call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>

<p id = "aspect"><strong>Aspect (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon's evolutions.</p>

<p id = "greater-shield-ally"><strong>Greater Shield Ally (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner's eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>

<p id = "life-bond"><strong>Life Bond (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, the summoner's life becomes linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don't deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/balefulPolymorph.html#baleful-polymorph" ><em>baleful polymorph</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/fleshToStone.html#flesh-to-stone" ><em>flesh to stone</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/imprisonment.html#imprisonment" ><em>imprisonment</em></a>, or other spells that don't deal damage.</p>

<p id = "merge-forms"><strong>Merge Forms (Su)</strong>: At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
	<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
	<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>

<p id = "greater-aspect"><strong>Greater Aspect (Su)</strong>: At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>

<p id = "twin-eidolon"><strong>Twin Eidolon (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

<h1 id = "unchained-summoner-spell-list">Unchained Summoner Spell List</h1>
<p>Summoners gain access to the following spells. Because they aren't always allowed for every type of character, spells from <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide</em>, <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Monster Codex</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures</em> aren't included in these lists. Such spells are cast at the levels indicated in those sources.</p>

<h1 id = "eidolons">Eidolons</h1>
<p>An eidolon's abilities are determined by the summoner's level and by the choices made using its evolution pool. <a href = "#eidolon-base-statistics">Table: Eidolon Base Statistics</a> determines many of the base statistics of the eidolon. Each eidolon possesses a base form that modifies these base statistics. Eidolons are outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.</p>
<p><strong>Class Level</strong>: This is the character's summoner level.</p>
<p><strong>HD</strong>: This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the eidolon possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.</p>
<p><strong>BAB</strong>: This is the eidolon's base attack bonus. An eidolon's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Good Saves and Poor Save</strong>: These are the eidolon's base saving throw bonuses. An eidolon possesses two good saving throws and one poor saving throw, determined by the creature's base form.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: This lists the eidolon's total skill ranks. An eidolon can assign skill ranks to any skill, but it must possess the appropriate appendages to use some skills. Eidolons with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (an eidolon gains a number of skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die). An eidolon cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Eidolon skill ranks are set once chosen, even if the creature's evolutions change when the summoner gains a new level.</p>
<p><strong>Feats</strong>: This is the total number of feats possessed by an eidolon. Eidolons can select any feat they qualify for, but they must possess the appropriate appendages to use some feats. Eidolon feats are set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the summoner gains a new level. If, due to such changes, the eidolon no longer qualifies for a feat, the feat has no effect until the eidolon once again qualifies for the feat.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Bonus</strong>: The number noted here is the eidolon's base total armor bonus. This bonus can be split between an armor bonus and a natural armor bonus, as decided by the summoner. This number is modified by the eidolon's base form and some options available through its evolution pool. An eidolon cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the summoner's connection to the eidolon.</p>
<p><strong>Str/Dex Bonus</strong>: Add this modifier to the eidolon's Strength and Dexterity scores, which are determined by its base form. Some options available through the eidolon's evolution pool might modify these scores.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution Pool</strong>: The value given in this column is the total number of points in the eidolon's evolution pool. Points in this pool can be spent on a wide variety of modifications and upgrades that add new abilities, attacks, and powers to the eidolon. Whenever the summoner gains a level, the number of points in this pool increases and the summoner can spend these points to change the abilities of the eidolon. These choices are not set&mdash;the summoner can change them whenever he gains a level (and through the <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/spells/transmogrify.html#transmogrify" ><em>transmogrify</em></a> spell).</p>
<p><strong>Max. Attacks</strong>: This indicates the maximum number of attacks that the eidolon is allowed to possess at the given level. If the eidolon is at its maximum, it cannot take evolutions that grant additional attacks. Attacks made with weapons, including those granted by a high base attack bonus, are counted against this maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: This includes a number of abilities gained by all eidolons as they increase in power (see the table below). Each of these bonuses is described below.</p>
<p id = "darkvision"><strong>Darkvision (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p id = "link"><strong>Link (Ex)</strong>: A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the summoner to give orders to his eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the summoner's connection to his eidolon. As a result, the summoner and his eidolon share magic item slots. For example, if the summoner is wearing a ring, his eidolon can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the summoner remain active, and those used by the eidolon become dormant. The eidolon must possess the appropriate appendages to use a magic item.</p>
<p id = "share-spells"><strong>Share Spells (Ex)</strong>: The summoner can cast a spell with a target of "you" on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A summoner can cast spells on his eidolon even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the eidolon's type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell list. This ability does not allow the eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.</p>
<p id = "evasion"><strong>Evasion (Ex)</strong>: If the eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw.</p>
<p id = "ability-score-increase"><strong>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon adds 1 to one of its ability scores.</p>
<p id = "devotion"><strong>Devotion (Ex)</strong>: An eidolon gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p id = "multiattack"><strong>Multiattack</strong>: An eidolon gains <a href="../../bestiary/monsterFeats.html#multiattack" >Multiattack</a> as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks (or it is reduced to fewer than three attacks), the eidolon instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a &ndash;5 penalty. If the eidolon later gains three or more natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead gains <a href="../../bestiary/monsterFeats.html#multiattack" >Multiattack</a>.</p>
<p id = "improved-evasion"><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex)</strong>: When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw and only half damage if it fails.</p>

<h2 id = "eidolon-skills">Eidolon Skills</h2>
<p>The following skills are class skills for eidolons: <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> (Cha), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (planes) (Int), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> (Wis), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> (Wis), and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, the summoner can choose four additional skills to be class skills for his eidolon. Note that eidolons with a fly speed gain <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> (Dex) as a free class skill, even if they do not gain a fly speed until a later level.</p>

<h2 id = "eidolons-and-alignment">Eidolons and Alignment</h2>
<p>Generally, the summoner controls the actions of his eidolon, even during combat, either through verbal commands or through the link ability, but this does not mean that the eidolon is a puppet that follows every command without question. Eidolons have been known to refuse actions that are against their ethoses or alignments (subject to the GM's discretion) and are quick to chide the summoner about such requests. In addition, should the action of the summoner cause a shift in alignment such that the summoner's alignment is more than one step away from the eidolon's, the eidolon refuses the call of the summoner (although the summoner can still use his <a href="#summon-monster">summon monster</a> class feature). If the summoner manages to restore his alignment, the eidolon returns to his service.</p>

<h2 id = "eidolon-subtypes">Eidolon Subtypes</h2>
<p>The first time a summoner calls his eidolon, he must decide on its subtype. The eidolon's subtype determines a number of its base statistics and abilities, as well as its overall look and theme. The subtype also determines what sort of evolutions the summoner can select for his eidolon using the evolution pool. Once the choice of subtype is made, it cannot be changed. </p>
<p>As a summoner gains levels, his eidolon gains specific evolutions based on its subtype. Each subtype entry below includes the following information.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: This is the name of the eidolon's subtype. The eidolon gains this as a subtype, but unless otherwise noted, it does not gain any of the features, abilities, or weaknesses of that subtype.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This gives a basic overview of eidolons of this subtype, including general guidelines on appearance and personality.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: The eidolon is a creature of this alignment. If its alignment is chaotic, evil, lawful, or good, it gains that subtype.</p>
<p><strong>Base Form</strong>: Eidolons of some subtypes are restricted in their choice of base form. Restrictions are spelled out here. The evolutions listed here are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon's <a href="#evolution-pool">evolution pool</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Base Evolutions</strong>: This describes the base evolutions possessed by all eidolons of this subtype. Following the entry is a list of evolutions gained as the summoner gains levels; these evolutions are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon's evolution pool. In some cases, eidolons of certain subtypes will gain abilities that are not evolutions. Unless otherwise noted, such abilities function as described in the <a href="../../bestiary/universalMonsterRules.html" >Universal Monster Rules</a>.</p>


<h3 id = "agathion">Agathion</h3>
<p>Patient and enlightened liaisons of the good-aligned Outer Planes, agathion eidolons seek to vanquish evil and protect that which is good. Agathion eidolons always have aspects of a single animal or creature, rather than a hodgepodge of several. Though they have patience for summoners with unorthodox methods and even those who stray from the path of good, they will not brook their powers being used for evil ends. An agathion eidolon seeks to bring its summoner closer to its own enlightenment.

<p>Hailing from the higher planes, angel eidolons are creatures of exquisite beauty. They usually appear in idealized humanoid forms, with smooth skin, shining hair, and bright eyes.

<h3 id = "archon">Archon</h3>
<p>Summoned from heaven, archon eidolons are the embodiments of righteousness. They often take on powerful, graceful forms, rippling with muscles but refined in their movements. Archon eidolons are totally dedicated to the cause of good, and have little patience for those who violate their oaths and ideals&mdash;including the summoner who called them. Archons will do whatever it takes to stop the advance of evil and protect the innocent.</p>

<h3 id = "azata">Azata</h3>
<p>Embodiments of the untamable beauty and noble passion of Elysium, azata eidolons have wild and beautiful features. They often take graceful forms reminiscent of elves or fey, but they occasionally appear like lillends, with serpentine tails. Azata eidolons are flighty and independent, and they often have their own ideas about how to defeat evil or have a good time. Thus, an azata eidolon is likely to balk if its summoner commands it to perform offensive or nefarious actions. On the other hand, an azata eidolon in sync with its summoner is a passionate and devoted companion.</p>

	<li>At 20th level, an azata eidolon gains the ability to switch between its normal form and an energy form as a standard action. In its energy form, an azata eidolon is incorporeal and doubles its fly speed, but it can't make natural or manufactured weapon attacks; it can, however, activate any spell-like ability evolutions it possesses.</li>

<h3 id = "daemon">Daemon</h3>
<p>The agents of horrible deaths, daemon eidolons desire the utter annihilation of all things. Their forms vary wildly depending on which type of death they embody, and daemon eidolons sometimes represent a more obscure kind of death than the most famous daemons. Daemon eidolons wish to sow death and misery through a variety of means. Most are capable of seeing the big picture, and will obediently follow even a neutral summoner. Ending lives is a typical part of an adventurer's career, so following along with a summoner gives a daemon eidolon many opportunities to gather mortal soul energy for its own dark and inscrutable purposes.</p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Neutral evil.</p>
<p><em>Base Form</em>: Biped (claws, limbs [arms], limbs [legs]), quadruped (limbs [legs, 2], bite), or serpentine (bite, reach [bite], reach [sting], sting, tail).</p>
<p><em>Base Evolutions</em>:
<ul>
	<li>Starting at 1st level, daemon eidolons gain the resistance (acid) evolution as well as a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, disease, and poison. </li>
	<li>At 4th level, daemon eidolons gain cold resistance 10, electricity resistance 10, and fire resistance 10.</li>

	<li>At 16th level, daemon eidolons lose the resistance (acid) evolution, and instead gain the immunity (acid) evolution. They also gain <a href="../../bestiary/universalMonsterRules.html#telepathy" >telepathy</a>.</li>
	<li>At 20th level, as a standard action, a daemon eidolon can devour a portion of the soul of a dying creature or a creature that died no earlier than 1 round ago. This kills the creature and provides the daemon eidolon a profane bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 24 hours. The bonus is equal to +1 per 5 Hit Dice the slain creature possessed. A creature whose soul was devoured in this way requires <em>resurrection </em>or more powerful magic to return from the dead. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id = "demon">Demon</h3>
<p>Raw destruction given material substance, demon eidolons form out of the Abyss's stew of soul energy, leading some scholars to speculate that the summoner's arts are related to the magical tampering that gave rise to the first demons. Demon eidolons revel in causing destruction and inflicting suffering, and they will do so for their summoners without question, taking pleasure in whatever havoc they can create. For a demon eidolon, the means justify the ends.</p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Chaotic evil.</p>

<h3 id = "devil">Devil</h3>
<p>Corruptors, tempters, and despoilers, devil eidolons often serve their summoners obediently and efficiently, all in a long-term attempt to damn the summoner's soul to the deepest depths of Hell. While some types of devils have truly unusual forms, devil eidolons have found that the more traditional bipedal form allows them to build up a strong rapport with their summoners&mdash;and consequently to corrupt them&mdash;more easily than if they possessed a more monstrous appearance.</p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Lawful evil.</p>
<p><em>Base Form</em>: Biped (claws, limbs [arms], limbs [legs]).</p>
<p><em>Base Evolutions</em>:

</p>

<h3 id = "div">Div</h3>
<p>Formed of hatred and spite, div eidolons seek to despoil and ruin all things beautiful and joyous. Div eidolons particularly resent having mortal masters, and seek to doom their summoners to existences full of suffering and loss. Each div eidolon has a unique compulsion it must follow&mdash;usually something similar to the doru's obsession with secrets&mdash;that leads it to bargain its loyalty for something the summoner provides. The div's summoner uses his eidolon's compulsion to entrap and control the eidolon. Still, div eidolons never fully give in, and continue to plot ways they might corrupt that which their masters hold dearest.</p>

<h3 id = "elemental">Elemental</h3>
<p>Pulled in from one of the four elemental planes, these eidolons are linked to one of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Generally, an elemental eidolon appears as a creature made entirely of one element, but there is some variation. Elemental eidolons are decidedly moderate in their views and actions. They tend to avoid the conflicts of others when they can and seek to maintain balance. The only exception is when facing off against emissaries of their opposing elements, which they hate utterly.</p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Neutral.</p>
<p><em>Base Form</em>: Biped (limbs [arms], limbs [legs], slam), quadruped (limbs [legs, 2], bite), or serpentine (bite, improved natural armor, reach [bite], tail, tail slap).</p>
<p><em>Base Evolutions</em>: The base evolutions of an elemental eidolon depend entirely on its chosen element. When first summoning an elemental eidolon, the summoner must select air, earth, fire, or water. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. The eidolon gains the following evolutions and abilities, which can vary depending on its element.</p>
<ul>
	<li>At 1st level, all elemental eidolons gain immunity to paralysis and sleep. In addition, air elemental eidolons gain the immunity (electricity) evolution. Earth elemental eidolons gain the immunity (acid) evolution. Fire elemental eidolons gain the immunity (fire) evolution. Water elemental eidolons gain the immunity (cold) evolution.</li>
	<li>At 4th level, all elemental eidolons add 1 point to their evolution pools.</li>
	<li>At 8th level, air elemental eidolons gain the flight evolution (using magic) with a speed equal to their base speed. Earth elemental eidolons gain the burrow evolution. Fire elemental eidolons increase their base speed by 20 feet. Water elemental eidolons gain the swim evolution twice, gaining a swim speed equal to their base speed + 20 feet. They also gain the gills evolution, which allows them to breathe underwater.</li>
	<li>At 12th level, all elemental eidolons gain immunity to bleed, poison, and stun. In addition, they can no longer be flanked.</li>
	<li>At 16th level, all elemental eidolons gain immunity to critical hits and do not take additional damage from precision-based attacks, such as sneak attack.</li>
	<li>At 20th level, an air elemental eidolon gains the <a href="../../bestiary/universalMonsterRules.html#whirlwind" >whirlwind</a> ability, with a maximum height of 15 feet (30 feet for a Large air elemental) and dealing 1d6 points of damage (1d8 for a Large air elemental). Earth elemental eidolons gain the <a href="../../bestiary/elemental.html#elemental-earth" >earth mastery</a> ability and DR 5/&mdash;. Fire elemental eidolons gain the energy attacks (fire) evolution and the <a href="../../bestiary/universalMonsterRules.html#burn" >burn</a> ability. Water elemental eidolons gain the <a href="../../bestiary/elemental.html#elemental-water" >drench and vortex</a> abilities. The vortex ability works as the air elemental eidolon's whirlwind ability (except as noted in the vortex ability's description).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id = "inevitable">Inevitable</h3>
<p>Implacable and ceaseless in their fight against chaos and those who break natural laws, inevitables make loyal, if literal-minded, companions for lawful summoners. Summoners of inevitables generally get along well with axiomites, who share their understanding of the process of forging and modifying an inevitable. Inevitable eidolons appear as a mixture between clockwork constructs and idealized humanoid statues.  </p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Lawful neutral.</p>
<p><em>Base Form</em>: Biped (limbs [arms], limbs [legs], slam).</p>
<p><em>Base Evolutions</em>:
<ul>
	<li>At 1st level, inevitable eidolons count as both constructs and outsiders for the purpose of effects such as the <em>bane</em> weapon special ability and the favored enemy class feature. They gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, disease, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, and stun. </li>
	<li>At 4th level, inevitable eidolons gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and immunity to nonlethal damage, fatigue, and exhaustion.</li>
	<li>At 8th level, inevitable eidolons gain immunity to death effects, disease, and poison.</li>
	<li>At 12th level, inevitable eidolons gain DR 5/chaotic. They also gain immunity to sleep, as well as the truespeech ability (see the <a href="../../bestiary/creatureTypes.html#inevitable-subtype" >inevitable subtype</a>).</li>
	<li>At 16th level, inevitable eidolons lose the +4 bonus on saving throws against necromancy effects and gain immunity to ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, and necromancy effects.</li>
	<li>At 20th level, inevitable eidolons gain immunity to paralysis, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects). </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id = "protean">Protean</h3>
<p>Serpentine beings of pure chaos, proteans seek to reshape reality. Protean eidolons appreciate creative summoners who often rebuild their forms and make liberal use of the <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/spells/transmogrify.html#transmogrify" ><em>transmogrify</em></a> spell. Beyond that, protean eidolons are happy to work with their summoners for any purpose, though they are quick to remind their summoners that while they have a mutually beneficial relationship, they are not servants. </p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Chaotic neutral.</p>
<p><em>Base Form</em>: Serpentine (bite, grab [tail slap], tail, tail slap).</p>
<p><em>Base Evolutions</em>:
<ul>
	<li>At 1st level, protean eidolons gain the resistance (acid) evolution as well as the grab evolution, tied to an attack type of the summoner's choice. Whenever the summoner changes the protean eidolon's evolutions, he can also change the attack type for grab.</li>
	<li>At 4th level, protean eidolons gain electricity resistance 10 and sonic resistance 10.</li>
	<li>At 8th level, protean eidolons gain the constrict evolution.</li>

</ul>
</p>


<h3 id = "psychopomp">Psychopomp</h3>
<p>Stewards, chroniclers, and guides of all things that die, psychopomps make dispassionate yet loyal eidolons. When they deal with the world of mortals, psychopomp eidolons nearly always wear masks. They do not tolerate summoners who traffic with daemons, undead, and other entities that interfere with the transmigration of souls, but otherwise they are comfortable with most actions on the summoner's part. When the summoner dies, a psychopomp eidolon personally escorts him to the afterlife and serves as an expert witness when it is time for him to be judged.</p>
<p><em>Alignment</em>: Neutral.</p>
<p><em>Base Form</em>: Biped (limbs [arms], limbs [legs], slam), quadruped (bite, limbs [legs, 2]), or serpentine (bite, pull [bite], reach [bite], tail, tail slap).</p>

	<li>At 12th level, psychopomp eidolons gain DR 5/adamantine. They also gain the spiritsense ability (see the <a href="../../bestiary/creatureTypes.html#psychopomp-subtype" >psychopomp subtype</a>).</li>
	<li>At 16th level, psychopomp eidolons gain the ability increase evolution, applied to an ability score of the summoner's choice. They also gain the ability to cast <em>invisibility</em> (self only) as a spell-like ability at will.</li>
	<li>At 20th level, psychopomp eidolons increase their damage reduction to 10/adamantine and gain the immunity (cold) and immunity (electricity) evolutions. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id = "base-forms">Base Forms</h2>
<p>Each eidolon has one of three base forms that determines its starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All natural attacks are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted (such as in the case of secondary attacks). An eidolon's attacks add the eidolon's Strength modifier to the damage rolls, unless the eidolon has only one attack, in which case the attack adds 1-1/2 times the eidolon's Strength modifier.</p>
<p>Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a Small eidolon. If the eidolon is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity. It takes a &ndash;4 penalty to Strength and a &ndash;2 penalty to Constitution. It also has a +1 size bonus to AC and on attack rolls, a &ndash;1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a +2 bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> checks, and a +4 bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> checks. Reduce the damage of all of its attacks by one step (for example, 1d6 becomes 1d4, and 1d4 becomes 1d3). If this choice is made, the eidolon can be made Medium whenever the summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool (which causes it to lose these modifiers for being Small). Likewise, a Medium eidolon can be made Small whenever the summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool.</p>

<h1 id = "evolutions">Evolutions</h1>
<p>Each eidolon gains a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus &ndash; 5 and add 1/2 the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the eidolon has only a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus, and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type.</p>
<p>Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever the summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can be selected only once.</p>


<h2 id = "1-point-evolutions">1-Point Evolutions</h2>
<p>The following evolutions cost 1 point from the eidolon's evolution pool.</p>
<p id = "bite"><strong>Bite (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite attack. This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If the eidolon already has a bite attack, this evolution allows it to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with its bite. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype.</p>

<p id = "claws"><strong>Claws (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon has a pair of vicious claws at the ends of its limbs, giving it two claw attacks. These attacks are primary attacks. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs evolution to take this evolution. This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of limbs evolutions the eidolon possesses. This evolution can be applied to any number of limbs (arms) evolutions, but no more than one limbs (legs) evolution. <em>Requirements</em>: Agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype.</p>

<p id = "blindsense"><strong>Blindsense (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon's senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense with a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it can't see without having to attempt a <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon. Visibility still affects the eidolon's movement, and it is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th.</p>

<p id = "burrow"><strong>Burrow (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth.

If the eidolon begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it can attempt a combat maneuver check to swallow the creature. The creature must be at least one size category smaller than the eidolon. Swallowed creatures take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each round + 1d6 points of damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light piercing or slashing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the eidolon's mouth, where it can attempt to escape or can be swallowed again. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th; agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype; grab (bite) evolution.</p>

The eidolon can use these webs to support itself plus one creature of up to the same size. It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to eight times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with a successful <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> check, or with a Strength check at a &ndash;4 penalty. The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The webs have a hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its webs. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 7th; daemon, demon, or protean subtype; climb evolution.</p>

<p id = "breath-weapon"><strong>Breath Weapon (Su)</strong>: The eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per Hit Dice it possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The eidolon can gain additional uses of this ability per day by spending 1 evolution point per additional use (to a maximum of three total uses per day). <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 9th.</p>

<p id = "fast-healing"><strong>Fast Healing (Su)</strong>: The eidolon's body gains the ability to heal wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals 1 point of damage per round, just like via  natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 point per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (to a maximum of 5 points per round). <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 11th.</p>

<p id = "large"><strong>Large (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The eidolon gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor.

If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains a reach of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total.</p>
	<p>If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead becomes Huge. The eidolon gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a &ndash;4 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a &ndash;2 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a 10-foot reach, a &ndash;4 penalty on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> checks, and a &ndash;8 penalty on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet instead of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from becoming Large. </p>
	<p>The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution points) when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a Large or Huge eidolon. <em>Requirements</em>: Summoner level 8th (13th for Huge), Medium size. </p>

<p id = "spell-resistance"><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex)</strong>: The eidolon is protected against magic, gaining spell resistance.
