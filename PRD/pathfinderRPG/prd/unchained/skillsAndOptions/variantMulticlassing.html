<h1 id = "variant-multiclassing">Variant Multiclassing</h1>
<p>Under the core rules, multiclassing can lead to a wide disparity in character ability. With this system, each character can choose a secondary class at 1st level that she trains in throughout her career, without giving up levels in her primary class. Once selected, this choice is permanent (though if using the <a href="../../ultimateCampaign/campaignSystems/retraining.html" >retraining rules</a> from <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>, the secondary class can be retrained by paying half the cost of retraining all her class levels). A character who selects this option doesn't gain feats at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, but instead gains class features from her secondary class as described on <a href="#multiclass-character-advancement">Table: Multiclass Character Advancement</a>. It is probably a good idea to use either this variant system or normal multiclassing, but it's possible for the two systems to be used together. In a game using both systems, a character can't take levels in the secondary class she gains from this variant.</p>
