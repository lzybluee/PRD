<h1 id = "skill-unlocks">Skill Unlocks</h1>
<p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the Signature Skill feat (see below) can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the <a href="../classes/rogue.html" >revised version of the rogue</a>, who uses her rogue's edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and bard, particularly in comparison to the rogue. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the Signature Skill feat, limiting skill unlocks to rogues and rogues alone.</p>


<h2 id = "signature-skill">Signature Skill (General)</h2>
<p>Your ability with a particular skill is the stuff of legends, and you can do things with that skill that others cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: 5 ranks in the chosen skill.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one skill. You gain the ability listed in that skill's 5 Ranks entry. As you gain more ranks in the chosen skill, you gain additional abilities. If you have 10 or more ranks in the chosen skill, you gain the appropriate abilities immediately. If your chosen skill is <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perform.html#perform" >Perform</a>, or <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/profession.html#profession" >Profession</a>, you gain the listed powers only for one category of that skill, such as <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (bows). This feat can be taken only once, but it stacks with the rogue's edge ability and the cutting edge rogue talent.</p>

<h2 id = "acrobatics">Acrobatics</h2>
<p>With sufficient ranks in <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a>, you earn the following.</p>
<p><strong>5 Ranks</strong>: You can move at normal speed through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity by increasing the DC of the check by 5 (instead of by 10). You aren't denied your Dexterity bonus when attempting <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> checks with DCs of 20 or lower. </p>
<p><strong>10 Ranks</strong>: You can attempt an <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check at a &ndash;10 penalty and use the result as your CMD against trip maneuvers. You can also attempt an <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check at a &ndash;10 penalty in place of a Reflex save to avoid falling. You must choose to use this ability before the trip attempt or Reflex save is rolled. With a successful DC 20 <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check, you treat an unintentional fall as 10 feet shorter plus 10 feet for every 10 by which you exceed the DC, and treat an intentional fall as 10 feet shorter for every 10 by which you exceed the DC. </p>
<p><strong>15 Ranks</strong>: You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when standing up from prone. </p>
<p><strong>20 Ranks</strong>: You double the result of any <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check when jumping and never fall prone at the end of a fall as long as you remain conscious.</p>


<h2 id = "appraise">Appraise</h2>
<p>With sufficient ranks in <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/appraise.html#appraise" >Appraise</a>, you earn the following.</p>
<p><strong>5 Ranks</strong>: A successful DC 20 <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/appraise.html#appraise" >Appraise</a> check reveals whether an item is magical, and a second check (DC = 25 + the item's caster level) unveils its properties. You can use <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/appraise.html#appraise" >Appraise</a> to detect non-written forgeries and counterfeits.</p>
<p><strong>10 Ranks</strong>: You can determine the most expensive object a creature is wearing or wielding (or in a 5-foot cube) as a standard action by succeeding at a DC 20 check. You never make a wildly inaccurate appraisal of an item's value.</p>
<p><strong>15 Ranks</strong>: Determining the most expensive object as above is a move action. You can substitute an <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/appraise.html#appraise" >Appraise</a> check at a &ndash;10 penalty for a Will save to disbelieve a figment or glamer. </p>
<p><strong>20 Ranks</strong>: Determining the most expensive object as above is a move action, and if the check succeeds, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to steal that object or disarm a creature of that object for 1 minute. </p>


<h2 id = "bluff">Bluff</h2>
<p>With sufficient ranks in <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a>, you earn the following.</p>
<p><strong>5 Ranks</strong>: The penalty to <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> a creature after a failed check is halved unless you failed by 5 or more. </p>
<p><strong>10 Ranks</strong>: You take no penalty to <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> a creature after a failed check unless you failed by 5 or more. </p>
