<h1 id = "scaling-items">Scaling Items</h1>
<p>Typically, player characters find themselves buying and selling magic items as they gain levels to keep up with the increasing threats they face. Items come and go from each character's inventory with such frequency that they hardly have the chance to impact the game's story. Scaling items, however, increase in power along with the characters who carry them, allowing an old and cherished item to develop and retain its utility rather than being sold and forgotten.</p>
<p>Scaling items work like normal magic items, but they gain new powers as their wielders gain levels, and their existing powers sometimes also improve. Additional item powers appear in a scaling magic item's entry with a header indicating the character level at which they unlock. </p>
<p>The caster level of the item scales up as well. A scaling item's effective caster level is its listed caster level or the character level of its wielder, whichever is higher, to a maximum of the item's highest-level ability.  For instance, if an item has a base caster level of 5th and additional abilities at 7th and 9th levels, it's treated as caster level 8th in the hands of an 8th-level character, but is treated as only caster level 9th in the hands of a 10th-level character.</p>
<p>Each scaling item has a base price that represents its value to a character whose level is equal to or less than the item's caster level. As the item's caster level increases in the hands of a more powerful character, the item's value increases as well. The values of such items fall into three categories (baubles, prizes, and wonders), which indicate the rough percentage of the character's wealth a scaling item represents.</p>
<p>The weakest items, baubles, represent 5% of a PC's <a href="../../coreRulebook/gamemastering.html#table-12-4-character-wealth-by-level" >character wealth at her level</a> and can be compared to consumable magic items (even though baubles aren't destroyed by use). Items in the middle category, prizes, represent 15% of a PC's suggested wealth and correspond to magic items of moderate power. An item of the most valuable category, wonders, represents 30% of a PC's suggested wealth and corresponds to a major magic item, such as a fighter's most beloved and powerful sword. Wonders exceed the normal cost assumptions of the game at their highest level. Such items approach the power of minor artifacts, though they're not indestructible and can still be created normally.</p>

<h2 id = "adjusting-treasure">Adjusting Treasure</h2>
<p>Since scaling items improve as characters level up, they effectively add wealth to their owners over time. To balance this out, the Game Master should reduce treasure awards in proportion to how many scaling items the party has. This can be done per character or for the whole group, as described below. Note that the original level and price of a scaling item don't matter once the character's level exceeds the minimum caster level of the item, since the item accrues value based on its category (bauble, prize, or wonder), not on its original price. The adjustments to treasure awards are the same for all items in a category.</p>

<p><strong>Per Character</strong>: If you apply the scaling item treasure reduction for each character, do so after dividing up shares of treasure for the characters. Reduce the treasure received by a character with a scaling item by the percentage listed for the item's category (5% for baubles, 15% for prizes, and 30% for wonders). If the character has multiple scaling items, combine the percentages before adjusting the amount of treasure.</p>
<p>For example, a PC with a wonder and a prize would receive 45% less treasure, because the PC has effectively already received that amount of treasure in the form of the items' increased values. Since the value of a scaling item is based on wealth for an entire level, apply this adjustment to every treasure allotment the character receives. If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items. This might be magical residue, vibrant crystals, or spellbook-style pages of magical phrases that increase the item's power. In any case, this substance should be treated as almost worthless to sell, and therefore useful only for upgrading scaling items.</p>
<p><strong>Group Basis</strong>: You can use the scaling items of the whole party to adjust treasure. This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters. For example, if a group of four PCs have between them one bauble, three prizes, and a wonder, their treasure is reduced by 20% (80% divided by 4).</p>

<h2 id = "maximum-level">Maximum Level</h2>
<p>Many scaling items unlock new powers all the way up to 20th level. Others reach the caps on their abilities at lower levels. Once an item reaches the level of its most powerful ability, stop adjusting treasure for that item. At that point, the scaling item is considered fully "paid for."</p>

<h2 id = "mismatched-levels">Mismatched Levels</h2>
<p>If a PC receives a scaling item of a caster level lower than her character level, she effectively receives an item that's worth more than the price listed in the stat block. Reference <a href="#value-of-scaling-items">Table: Value of Scaling Items</a> and use the PC's level to estimate how much the item is really worth to that PC, and use that purchase price as its treasure value. Giving an item with a caster level higher than the character's level doesn't present the same problems; it just means the PC won't be unlocking the item's higher-level powers for some time. Don't reduce treasure for such an item until the PC's level exceeds the item's caster level.</p>

<h2 id = "buying-and-selling">Buying and Selling</h2>
<p>Selling a scaling item presents a tricky balance proposition. Such an item is worth more to a higher-level buyer, and a high-level seller has spent more effective wealth acquiring and keeping the item. The maximum amount a PC can get for a scaling item is half the value (as normal for selling magic items) listed on <a href="#value-of-scaling-items">Table: Value of Scaling Items</a> for the item's category and the PC's current level. To get this amount, the PC must find a motivated buyer of her level or higher, which may involve considerable time and effort. If the PC must sell in a hurry, she might get 25% of the listed value, or even less. A PC can't sell a scaling item for more than 50% of the item's value for her current level, even if she sells it to a higher-level NPC.</p>

<h2 id = "crafting">Crafting</h2>
<p>Scaling items must be crafted at their highest level of power, with a cost determined by referencing <a href="#value-of-scaling-items">Table: Value of Scaling Items</a>. Start with the value listed on the table for the item's category and its highest-level ability. Divide this by 2 to get the crafting cost, and add the value of any nonmagical armor or weapon component. The crafting cost is always much higher than the market price of a scaling item, since the crafting cost is based on the full set of abilities but the market price is based on the minimum caster level. When a PC crafts a scaling item, he doesn't need to pay any further cost in reduced treasure for keeping the item, because the full value of the item has already been accounted for. When setting the DC for crafting a scaling item, use the item's highest-level ability instead of its base caster level.</p>

<h2 id = "pricing-new-scaling-items">Pricing New Scaling Items</h2>
<p>To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing the Base Item</strong>: First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the normal rules for <a href="../../coreRulebook/magicItems/magicItemCreation.html" >creating magic items</a>. Then, using the column on <a href="#value-of-scaling-items">Table: Value of Scaling Items</a> that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level. </p>
<p><strong>Adding Scaling Abilities</strong>:Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.</p>
<p><em>Adding Unlockable Abilities</em>: Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/burningHands.html#burning-hands" ><em>burning hands</em></a> effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/burningHands.html#burning-hands" ><em>burning hands</em></a> so well.</p>
<p><em>Adding Spells</em>: Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. <a href="#spell-prices">Table: Spell Prices</a> includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/fireball.html#fireball" ><em>fireball</em></a>), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/fireball.html#fireball" ><em>fireball</em></a>. Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level. </p>
<p>Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.</p>
<p><em>Assigning an Unlock Level</em>: Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).</p>
<p><strong>Completing the Item</strong>: Repeat this process for each set of new powers. Try to add a new unlockable ability every 2 to 4 levels. It's not necessary to scale every item all the way to 20th level, however&mdash;stop when the set of abilities feels complete.</p>

	<p class = "stat-block">The smooth surface of this rod is polished to a mirror sheen. Two cabochons&mdash;one amber and one viridian&mdash;set into the ends of the rod control its functions. A creature can press the viridian stone and roll the rod across a piece of writing on a flat surface to copy that writing into the rod, leaving the original text intact. By pressing the amber cabochon and rolling the rod across a different flat surface, a creature can replicate the original text. The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a <em>mimetic rod</em>, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook. The rod can't copy traps that use magical writing, such as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/explosiveRunes.html#explosive-runes" ><em>explosive runes</em></a>, but attempting to do so doesn't trigger the trap unless the movement of the magic item over the text would normally trigger it.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>9th Level</strong>: The rod can be used to copy faces. It must first be waved in front of either a person's actual face or a high-quality reproduction while the wielder presses the viridian cabochon. The stored face can then be replicated over someone else's face as though they'd been affected by <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/disguiseSelf.html#disguise-self" ><em>disguise self</em></a> (though this can change only the face&mdash;not height, weight, or other features). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level possessed by the person activating the rod (to a maximum of 140 minutes). The rod can store only one face at a time, and can't store a face while it's storing text.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>11th Level</strong>: If the rod's user speaks the name of a language, the rod automatically translates any text stored in it to that language. When that text is reproduced, it comes out in the language it has been translated to. A piece of text can be translated any number of times while stored in the rod.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>14th Level</strong>: The rod can copy and reproduce magical traps that rely on text, including <em>symbols</em>. The rod's user must succeed at a caster level check (caster level 14th) with a DC equal to 11 + the targeted spell's caster level to do so. If she succeeds, the trap is stored harmlessly in the rod and can be replicated just as text would. Unlike with normal text, the spell is erased from inside the rod when it's replicated. The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged. The rod's wielder can also press the viridian cabochon to harmlessly extinguish the spell instead of reproducing it.</p>

Commanders of undead legions often wield such rods as symbols of authority. Changing the weapon's type can be used to signal a change in strategy for the undead horde, with the mace indicating a steady march, the morningstar calling for an aggressive assault, a flail indicating a retreat, and so on. </p>

This negative level lasts for 12 hours, and can't become a permanent negative level.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>15th Level</strong>: If the wielder confirms a critical hit, instead of gaining a temporary negative level the target gains a permanent negative level with no saving throw.

	<p class = "stat-block">This elaborate tiara looks as though it's made of intricately carved ice adorned with small, crystalline gemstones. Despite the item's fragile appearance, it has hardness 12 and 10 hit points. Its wearer gains the constant effects of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/endureElements.html#endure-elements" ><em>endure elements</em></a> against cold conditions only.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>5th Level</strong>: Once per day, the wearer can summon a Small ice elemental as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-ii" ><em>summon monster II</em></a>.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>7th Level</strong>: As a standard action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged attack. On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, the wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>10th Level</strong>: As part of her move action, the wearer can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new steps in whichever direction she travels. These steps melt away behind her. If others try to climb the steps, they crumble away, leaving only the portions beneath the wearer's feet intact. This otherwise acts as the <em>air walk </em>spell. She can use this ability each day for 10 minutes per level, divided any way she chooses in 10-minute intervals.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>12th Level</strong>: Once per day, the wearer can call forth an <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/iceStorm.html#ice-storm" ><em>ice storm</em></a>.

	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>16th Level</strong>: The wearer can use the tiara to call up a tower of ice, as an <em>instant fortress</em> (except that the tiara does not transform into the tower, the tower takes 1 minute to rise instead of 1 round, the walls of the tower have only hardness 12, and damage to the tower does not carry over between multiple uses of this ability). </p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>18th Level</strong>: When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she can choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base with 20-foot-high rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high. At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that can move at incredible speed. Treat this as <em>wind walk </em>except she gains vulnerability to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However, she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so, she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can choose to summon 1d4+1 Medium ice elementals, 1d3 Large ice elementals, or one Huge ice elemental as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/summonMonster.html#summon-monster-vi" ><em>summon monster VI</em></a>.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>20th Level</strong>: The wearer gains cold resistance 30.

She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs to fall. </p>

	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>10th Level</strong>: The rags begin to crawl with insects and spiders, granting the wearer familiarity with the feeling of tiny creatures crawling over her body.

This functions as though the wearer had concentrated on the creature for 3 rounds using <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectThoughts.html#detect-thoughts" ><em>detect thoughts</em></a>, and can be blocked with a successful Will save with a DC equal to the wearer's character level + 6 (to a maximum DC of 20). A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected again for 24 hours. Maintaining concentration requires a standard action each round (as for a spell), and once the wearer ceases concentrating on a creature, she cannot observe thoughts again for 1 minute. This ability can be used for a total of 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. The glasses fail to function against creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower or without a written language.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>11th Level</strong>: The competence bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> checks increases to +8. The <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectThoughts.html#detect-thoughts" ><em>detect thoughts</em></a> effect can be used for 10 minutes per day. In addition to seeing the creature's thoughts in its native language, the wearer gets visual impressions of the creature's thoughts. She might see the face of someone the creature is thinking about, for instance, or see an image of that creature stabbing someone if it's planning an attack.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>13th Level</strong>: The competence bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> checks increases to +10. The <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectThoughts.html#detect-thoughts" ><em>detect thoughts</em></a> effect is constant&mdash;the wearer no longer needs to concentrate to maintain it, and there is no longer a limit on the number of rounds per day.</p>

	<p class = "stat-block">When touched to an eye, this star-shaped gem affixes itself until willingly removed or pried from an unconscious wearer. On command, the wearer can share her vision of her surroundings with allies within 60 feet. This gives them the benefit of any special visual sense she has (such as darkvision or <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/seeInvisibility.html#see-invisibility" ><em>see invisibility</em></a>) and even allows blind allies to see, assuming the wearer is not herself blind. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and once used, can't be activated again for 30 minutes. While the effect is active, an ally of the wearer can switch back and forth at will between sharing the wearer's vision and seeing through his own eyes.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>12th Level</strong>: The shared senses effect lasts for 10 minutes. While sharing senses, the wearer automatically discovers the number and location of secret doors in a 60-foot cone in front of her, as though she had been studying the area for 2 rounds with <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectSecretDoors.html#detect-secret-doors" ><em>detect secret doors</em></a>.

	<p class = "stat-block">This garment is lined with gilded leaves, magically preserved in their autumnal splendor. The leaves retain this natural appearance in urban areas or natural settings other than forests or wooded areas. When the wearer is in a forest environment, the vest's leaves change to match the local flora. As long as the wearer moves no more than half her base speed in a given round, she gains a +4 bonus on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> checks and can attempt <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> checks without cover or concealment.

	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>11th Level</strong>: Once per day, the wearer can either assume <em>tree shape </em>or transform herself into a cloud of leaves floating, falling, and swirling about in a mass the same size as the wearer's actual body. This leaf form is equivalent to <em>gaseous form,</em> but the wearer also gains vulnerability to fire. </p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>13th Level</strong>: The wearer can, in place of using either of the vest's 11th-level abilities, choose to release a number of leaves equal to 1/2 her Hit Dice as remote magical sensors.

	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>11th Level</strong>: Once per day, the wearer can remove the shaken or sickened condition from himself or an ally with a touch. This is a standard action, or a swift action if he cures himself. In addition, the wearer can't be compelled to keep a cursed item. This doesn't prevent the cursed item's effects, but does allow the wearer to freely discard the item.</p>
	<p class = "stat-block"><strong>13th Level</strong>: Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can use <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/breakEnchantment.html#break-enchantment" ><em>break enchantment</em></a> against an effect that has just taken hold of him, even if the effect causes him to lose consciousness or control of his actions.
