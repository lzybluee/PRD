<p>This section details new gear and magic items for the Pathfinder RPG. A number of these items complement the class features and abilities of the new classes presented in this book, and others improve characters' ability to use occult skill unlocks, but most of these items are useful in many different situations. Spells and items marked with an asterisk (*) are introduced in this book.</p>

<h1 id = "occult-adventuring-gear">Adventuring Gear</h1>
<p>The items found on the Adventuring Gear table are described below, along with any special benefits they provide to the user ("you").</p>
<p><b>Kits</b>: This section includes kits of preselected gear for each character class in <i>Occult Adventures</i> and for other specific purposes. GMs can use the kits to quickly round out an NPC's gear. Players can use them to equip new PCs in a hurry or provide gear to cohorts, followers, minions, and hirelings. The listed price for each kit includes a discount for purchasing these items as a group. Items in a kit that are used up, destroyed, or lost cost the full price to replace.</p>

<p id = "artist-poster" class = "stat-block-title">Artist's Poster</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 15 gp; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This illustrated piece of paper typically measures 24 inches wide and 32 inches long. An artist's poster is typically used as an advertisement that can be easily seen by crowds of people. Placing a poster within a settlement grants creatures a +1 circumstance bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy"  >Diplomacy</a> checks to gather information regarding the subject of the poster. If the settlement's population is greater than 1,000 people, one additional poster must be placed for every additional 1,000 people (or portion thereof) to gain the bonus. The cost of this item includes commissioning an artist of appropriate talent to complete the poster, and copies of the poster beyond the first cost 5 sp each.</p>

<p id = "aura-goggles" class = "stat-block-title">Aura Goggles</p>

<p class = "stat-block">These leather goggles have dark, purple-hued lenses coated with a special alchemical substance that reveals particular psychic spectrums. To provide any benefit, the goggles must be continuously worn for 1 hour, during which time the wearer takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all sight-based <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception"  >Perception</a> checks. After this 1-hour period, the user can remove the goggles to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception"  >Perception</a> checks for the read aura occult skill unlock. This benefit fades after 1 hour.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">This telescopic horn is constructed of thin sheets of tin rolled into concentric cones, and measures about 3 feet long when fully extended. Primarily used by fraudulent mediums to disguise the true source of mysterious voices in darkened seance chambers, these trumpets add 1 to the DCs of saving throws to disbelieve the effects of the <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/ghostSound.html#ghost-sound" ><em>ghost sound</em></a> and <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/ventriloquism.html#ventriloquism" ><em>ventriloquism</em></a> spells.

<p class = "stat-block">Though a talking board can be used for some of the same functions as other gear (such as automatic writing planchettes and hypnotist's lockets), these items can't be used in unison to gain multiple bonuses or increase the rate of communication with a haunt to more than double.</p>

Dispelling the <a href="spells/objectPossession.html#object-possession" ><em>object possession</em></a> effect on the ring banishes the soul from the ring to its appropriate afterlife. Otherwise, a soul can remain in the ring indefinitely. While in the ring, the soul knows when a creature has put on the ring.

<h2 id = "occult-scrolls">Scrolls</h2>
<p>Scrolls are divided based on the type of magic used to create the scroll; psychic spellcasters create psychic scrolls in much the same way arcane spellcasters create arcane scrolls and divine spellcasters create divine scrolls. Psychic scrolls follow all the same rules as other scrolls. A psychic scroll is a spell completion item that requires the user to decipher and read the scroll. The user must also provide all necessary components except material and focus components (which were provided by the scroll's creator). This includes thought and emotion components.</p>
<p>Normally, there's a 70% chance a scroll will be arcane and a 30% chance it will be divine. When determining treasure randomly in a game that includes psychic magic, use the table below instead.</p>

<p>A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Staves usually hold spells grouped by a theme and sometimes possess other abilities that they grant to the wielder. A staff has 10 charges when created but can be recharged by a spellcaster with the appropriate spells.</p>

<li><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/repulsion.html" ><em>repulsion</em></a> (3 charges)</li></ul>
<p>If the wielder of a <em>vril staff</em> is a spellcaster, as a standard action, she can expend 1 charge and sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to channel the power through the staff as a blast of raw magical energy known as vril. This ray resolves as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, and the wielder chooses whether it deals damage or heals. The amount of damage dealt or healed by the ray is equal to 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed + 1 point per caster level of the wielder.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">In the hands of a kineticist, the staff functions differently. By spending 1 charge from the staff as part of her kinetic blast, the kineticist can use a new basic energy blast called a vril blast. This blast deals untyped damage. A vril blast works only with form and substance infusions that specify that they work on any blast. If the kineticist instead spends 3 charges, her vril blast's intensity increases and it ignores spell resistance. A kineticist can use a <em>vril staff</em> without attempting a <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/useMagicDevice.html#use-magic-device"  >Use Magic Device</a> check.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A spellcaster can recharge a <em>vril staff</em> normally. A kineticist can restore a single charge to a <em>vril staff</em> by accepting 3 points of burn.</p>

<h2 id = "occult-wondrous-items">Wondrous Items</h2>
<p>"Wondrous item" is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into other groups (such as weapons, staves, and so on). Wondrous items are a diverse group. Some must be worn in a specific magic item slot in order to work, while others must merely be possessed and utilized. Anyone can use a wondrous item unless the item's description specifies otherwise. Many of the items presented here require the user to have some psychic connection to function, as specified in the item's description.</p>
<p>There are two main categories of wondrous items: slotted and slotless. Slotted items take up a magic item slot, and must be worn by those who want to benefit from them.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">A <em>ganji doll</em> is a fetish tied so intimately to its intended victim that good or ill can be done to the target through the doll itself. During the item's creation, the creator must choose a humanoid creature to bind the doll to. This requires the creator to obtain and craft a bit of the intended target's body&mdash;typically hair, blood, or a tooth&mdash;into the fetish. Once this has been done, the <em>ganji doll</em> affects no other creature aside from the bound target. The target of the <em>ganji doll</em> can't be changed after crafting is complete.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Once the doll has been created, three times per day, any bearer can employ the doll to create any one of the following effects. These effects target only the creature bound to the doll. The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all saving throws against these effects.</p>

<p class = "stat-block"><b>Touch Spell</b>: The <em>ganji doll</em> functions as the bound target for the purpose of any spell with a range of touch.

<p class = "stat-block">When sprinkled on the ground, this mixture of salt and powdered iron forms a barrier that is invisible and impenetrable for spirits. <em>Ghost powder</em> is typically found in bags or tubes, and a single dose of <em>ghost powder</em> can trace a line up to 50 feet in length; it can be used in 5-foot increments. Corporeal creatures can cross a line of <em>ghost powder</em>, but ethereal and incorporeal creatures are blocked as though the line were a <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/wallOfForce.html#wall-of-force" ><em>wall of force</em></a>. Teleportation effects can cross a line of <em>ghost powder</em>, as can an incorporeal creature possessing a corporeal creature. The barrier created is 10 feet high. It prevents incorporeal creatures from crossing through the floor directly beneath it, and if the barrier reaches the ceiling, it prevents them from crossing through the ceiling directly above. In addition, if <em>ghost powder</em> is sprinkled in front of every entrance (including chimneys, air vents, and the like) of a building, it prevents incorporeal creatures from entering the building through the walls, floor, and ceiling in their entirety. Sweeping away the <em>ghost powder</em> destroys the barrier, but incorporeal and ethereal creatures can't disturb the powder or affect it with their abilities unless they deal enough damage to destroy the barrier itself. When laid down quickly (up to 10 feet can be spread as a standard action), the effects of <em>ghost powder</em> last for 1 hour. If the powder is laid down carefully (taking 1 minute for every 5 feet), the effects last 8 hours.</p>

Incorporeal touch attacks within this area resolve as melee attacks, but the incorporeal creatures add their Charisma bonus on such attacks. Incorporeal creatures still lack cohesion and mass.

<p class = "stat-block">This especially heavy leather hoodwink cowl is designed to quiet the wearer's mundane senses, allowing him to focus on his supernatural senses. Donning or removing the hood requires 1 minute, or 5 rounds with assistance.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">As with a normal hoodwink cowl, the wearer of a <em>sensory deprivation hood</em> is blinded, deafened, and takes a &ndash;10 penalty on all other <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception"  >Perception</a> checks. If the wearer has blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or a similar ability, he can take a full-round action to suppress those senses for as long as he wears the hood or until he resumes using them (which requires another full-round action). If the wearer is currently benefitting from one of these senses, he gains no benefits from the hood.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">As long as the wearer's senses are suppressed, he gains the ability to perform automatic writing, dowsing, and psychometry even if he doesn't have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If he does have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, he gains a +5 bonus on skill checks for those skill unlocks.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Additionally, once per day while wearing the <em>sensory deprivation hood</em>, the wearer can open up his mind to passing spiritual phenomena in the hope of gaining greater insight into a specific issue. This functions as <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/contactOtherPlane.html#contact-other-plane" ><em>contact other plane</em></a>, allowing the wearer to ask up to 5 questions per use, but rather than contacting an entity on another plane of existence, the wearer contacts a nearby spirit or other psychic entity.

<p class = "stat-block">The mouth of this shriveled, distorted head is stitched shut with coarse thread. A <em>shrunken head</em> can be used if it's held in one hand or worn in the neck slot by suspending it from a thong. Once per day as an immediate action, the owner can make the head absorb a mind-affecting spell of up to 5th level that was targeting the owner. Absorbing such a spell protects only the wielder, not any other targets. After absorbing the spell, the head's eyes open and burn with pale green fire for 1 round per level of the spell absorbed. While the eyes are burning, as a standard action, the wielder can unleash this energy as <em>enervation</em>, with the ray imposing 1 negative level per level of spell absorbed.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">When used as an additional focus component for a spell with the fear subtype, a <em>shrunken head</em> augments its effects, increasing any save DC associated with the spell by 1.

<p class = "stat-block">The wielder of this hand-sized, fine glass mirror can view another's reflection in the mirror to capture a portion of that creature's soul. Doing so requires the wielder to avert his eyes as if defending against a gaze attack so that he views the creature only by its reflection, and then take a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This imposes 1 temporary negative level on the creature reflected (Fortitude DC 16 negates). A <em>soultheft glass</em> can hold no more than three portions of a creature's soul, and can't contain portions from more than one creature's soul at a time. When the glass is at full capacity, attempts to steal additional soul portions fail. While the mirror retains at least one soul portion, its possessor receives a +1 luck bonus on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The wielder can query the soul portions trapped within, in effect questioning echoed memories of the target creature. This works as <a href="spells/callSpirit.html#call-spirit" ><em>call spirit</em></a>, except the creature doesn't need to be dead. The wielder can ask a number of questions per day equal to the number of soul portions in the glass.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Temporary negative levels bestowed by a <em>soultheft glass</em> never become permanent. The victim can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove each negative level every 24 hours. Success removes that negative level and frees one soul portion held within the glass. Any other method of removing a negative level (such as <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/restoration.html" ><em>restoration</em></a>) also frees a soul portion from the glass.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Once it imposes a temporary negative level on a creature, a <em>soultheft glass</em> shows a ghostly reflection of that creature (though not any information about its surroundings) until all soul portions have been returned. If the victim dies, its soul portions fade after 24 hours. As a standard action, the mirror's wielder can release all soul portions, which also removes the victim's negative levels.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">These unusual hand-mirrors allow the user to communicate with the spirits of the recently deceased, although such communication comes with great risk. On command, the user can look into the mirror and name a recently deceased individual, attempting to conjure the image of that person's spirit into the mirror.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">There is a 70% chance that an attempt to contact a specific spirit succeeds.

If the attempt is unsuccessful, the <em>spirit mirror</em> ceases to function for 1d4 days and can never contact that particular spirit.

<p class = "stat-block">The user can fold pages to craft a fantastic variety of Small, Medium, and Large animated constructs.

Each night, there is a 10% chance that the owner needs to attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a failure, the owner gains no rest for the night and can't recover spells, pools, or other daily abilities.</p>

<p id = "maniac-hand" class= "stat-block-title">Maniac Hand</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none (replaces hand); <b>CL</b> 13th; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong necromancy</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This dried and withered hand ends in a jagged stump. When it is touched against the arm stump of a humanoid who has lost a hand, the <em>maniac hand</em> bonds instantly and returns to a lifelike appearance. It shrinks or grows to match the size of its new owner, and transforms itself to match the hand lost, becoming either a right or left hand. After merging, an uneven scar and unhealthy hue identify it as alien to its new owner.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Attacks made with a <em>maniac hand</em> receive a +2 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. In addition, when making a full attack, the wielder can accept a &ndash;2 penalty to AC in order to make one extra attack with the hand using the wielder's full base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/haste.html" ><em>haste</em></a> spell. For the purposes of these bonuses, any weapon held in the <em>maniac hand</em> or in both hands qualifies, and the hand itself can deal damage as a slam attack appropriate to the wielder's size (1d4 for a Medium creature).</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>maniac hand</em> has an insidious will that slowly usurps control from the owner. It has Intelligence 8, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10. Incapable of communication and bereft of rational thought, a <em>maniac hand</em> knows only an insatiable urge to destroy. When first attached, a <em>maniac hand</em> has an Ego score of 5. At least once each day, when presented with an opportunity to murder a friend or innocent without being witnessed, the <em>maniac hand</em> attempts to assert control using the rules for items against characters. If it succeeds, the hand takes control of its owner until it can commit the murder or 5 minutes pass, whichever comes first. The owner remembers nothing of the crime save a blinding rage, and the hand's Ego score returns to 5. If the hand fails to assert control, the owner feels a momentary surge of anger, but can't identify the source. Each day that passes without the hand's murderous impulse killing a creature of Intelligence 3 or higher, its Ego score increases by 1. If its Ego score increases above 20, the hand no longer cares for caution, and attempts murder regardless of the chance of getting caught.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>maniac hand</em> that's denied the death of friends or innocents for more than 30 days turns against its owner. If in a position to sabotage the owner, such as by letting go of a rope, it attempts to assert control. It can assert control while the owner sleeps, strangling its host or seizing a weapon to deliver a coup de grace. The hand attempts such an act at most once per day. An owner willing to slaughter innocents can keep the hand satisfied by finding an innocent victim and voluntarily relinquishing control to the hand.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">If the owner tries to rid herself of the <em>maniac hand</em> by destroying or amputating it, the hand resists to the best of its ability. It makes attacks and one-handed grapple attempts with its owner's own Strength and Dexterity scores, augmented by the hand's bonuses. The hand has an AC equal to its owner's touch AC, except with a +4 size bonus that stacks with its owner's size modifier. Its owner loses her Dexterity bonus against the hand's attacks, but the hand retains its Dexterity bonus against its owner. The hand's hp is equal to 1/4 that of its owner.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Successfully casting <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/removeCurse.html" ><em>remove curse</em></a> on a <em>maniac hand</em> prevents it from resisting amputation for 1 hour.</p>

<p id = "mirror-of-soul-sharing" class= "stat-block-title">Mirror of Soul Snaring</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 15th; <b>Weight</b> 45 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong necromancy</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This normal mirror is roughly 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It is similar to a <em>mirror of opposition</em> or <em>mirror of life trapping</em>, but it lacks a command word. A <em>mirror of soul snaring</em> has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or have its soul sucked into one of the compartments. A creature not aware of the cursed nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection and thus needing to attempt the saving throw drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror is cursed and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).</p>
<p class = "stat-block">When a creature's soul is trapped, its body remains outside of the mirror. The body becomes possessed by a malignant spirit who behaves in a way entirely opposed to how the trapped creature would. Treat this spirit as the creature, with a reversed alignment (and potentially other factors reversed, such as being an antipaladin instead of a paladin). In the case of neutral characters, the spirit can be either chaotic evil or lawful good as decided by the GM. The death of the creature's original body does not free its soul from the mirror, though if it is ever set free, it immediately passes on to the afterlife as it no longer has a body to inhabit.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim's soul (determined randomly) is set free and immediately reconnects with its duplicate body if available. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed. Unless the mirror is destroyed, not even a <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/miracle.html" ><em>miracle</em></a> or <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/wish.html" ><em>wish</em></a> can restore the trapped creature's spirit to its body.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.; <b>Aura</b> strong universal</p>
<p class = "stat-block">This mummified monkey's hand bears the power to grant three wishes, but at a terrible cost. The paw can grant any request within the power of a <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/wish.html" ><em>wish</em></a> spell, but the paw's curse twists the results to bring about despair. For example, a wish to prevent an erupting volcano from burying a town might drain the magma vault beneath the volcano, resulting in the town being swallowed up in a sinkhole when the vault collapses into a caldera. Careful wording to avoid negative effects simply results in the attempt failing without expending a wish. When the <em>monkey's paw</em> grants a wish, it writhes in the holder's grasp.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Once the third wish of a monkey's paw is used, it loses its power for those who used the wishes and their acquaintances, but regains its power once passed on to a stranger.</p>

<h1 id = "occult-artifacts">Artifacts</h1>
<p>Unlike normal magic items, artifacts are not easily destroyed (and are impossible for PCs to create). Instead of construction information, each artifact includes one possible means by which it might be destroyed.</p>
<p>Artifacts should never be purchased or found as part of a random treasure hoard. When placing an artifact in your game, be sure to consider its impact, but also keep in mind that artifacts are fickle objects, and if they become too much of a nuisance, they can easily become lost once more.</p>

<h2 id = "occult-minor-artifacts">Minor Artifacts</h2>
<p>The artifacts presented here are all minor artifacts. Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that can no longer be created by common mortal means.</p>

<p id = "portal-network" class= "stat-block-title">Portal Network</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 64,000 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Runes adorn this massive ring of iron. Each gate of a <em>portal network</em> is bound to at least one other such gate and instantly transports any creature who steps through it to its mate, anywhere on the same plane or any other plane. <em>Portal network</em> gates allow the passage of Large or smaller creatures. Huge creatures are not transported, even if they manage to squeeze through the ring. If the destination gate is obstructed by an immovable object, the network fails to function.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Portal networks</em> with more than two gates distinguish between destinations via focal objects chosen by the gates' creators. Typical focal objects include gems, minor magic items, and carefully drawn sigils. Some gates fail to function at all if entered without a focal object, whereas others transport the subject to a default location. Creatures can share a focal object by touching each other as they pass through the gate. Gates with multiple focal objects have a set priority (established at the creation of the <em>portal network</em>) that determines which focal objects supersede the others.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><em>Portal networks</em> work an unlimited number of times. Once a gate is activated, impenetrable darkness fills the gate's ring until 1 round after the last creature passes through. A creature doesn't reach the other end until it passes fully through the ring, and can't see the other side until it finishes passing through.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">If a <em>portal network</em> requires a focal object, only creatures using a focal object or touching someone else who is can pass through a gate, even if the gate is activated. Obstructing a gate (such as by building a wall against the gate's opening) prevents anyone from passing through, but a creature standing in the way does not; a creature occupying the gate is pushed aside once anyone passes through.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Destruction</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Destroying a <em>portal network</em> entirely requires sending a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> through one of the network's gates. This destroys the sphere as well (as described in the destruction requirements for a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>), except a gap is always torn in the spatial fabric.</p>

<p id = "primordial-symbol" class= "stat-block-title">Primordial Symbol</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Its origin lost in the infinite expanse of time, a <em>primordial symbol</em> is a polished stone bearing a mystic sign that resembles a lopsided, two-barred cross. When held forth and invoked by a bearer who is able to cast psychic spells or has the Psychic Sensitivity feat, a <em>primordial symbol</em> flares with an invisible flash in a 100-foot-radius burst, which has the following effects on those in range.</p>
<ul><li>Creatures with 40 Hit Dice or fewer with the extraplanar subtype are returned to their home planes as though by the <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/banishment.html#banishment" ><em>banishment</em></a> spell, regardless of spell resistance and with no save permitted. This includes extraplanar entities possessing other creatures.</li>
<li>Any non-extraplanar entities possessing other creatures or extraplanar entities with more than 40 Hit Dice possessing other creatures are driven out of their hosts.</li>
<li>All eidolons, medium spirits, and phantoms are dismissed.</li>
<li>All psychic spells in the area are dispelled as though by <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic-greater" ><em>greater dispel magic</em></a>, with no caster level check required.</li>
<li>All abjuration effects and <em>magic circles</em> in the area are similarly dispelled.</li>
<li>All creatures are blinded for 1 round (Reflex DC 22 negates).</li></ul>
<p class = "stat-block">Other creatures and objects within the area are otherwise unharmed. When the symbol is activated, its wielder takes 2d6 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage, rolled separately for each ability. The <em>primordial symbol</em> then collapses in on itself and vanishes, only to reappear unharmed in a distant land or world.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Destruction</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Though seemingly destroyed by activation, the eldritch potential bound into a <em>primordial symbol</em> persists and recreates the symbol elsewhere in the multiverse. To permanently destroy the artifact, the <em>primordial symbol</em> must be brought to a realm of pure chaos at the unformed edges of the Outer Planes and melted in the primal energy of creation.</p>

<p id = "soul-portrait" class= "stat-block-title">Soul Portrait</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 25 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong necromancy</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>soul portrait</em> is a painting imbued with immense magical power attached to a solid wooden frame. The exact image presented on each <em>soul portrait</em> varies, and has a magical effect only if it depicts the likeness of its current owner. The owner doesn't need to be depicted alone, and additional figures painted in the background don't interfere with the effect.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The owner of a <em>soul portrait</em> doesn't appear to age and no longer takes the penalties associated with aging, but she still gains the appropriate mental bonuses. As the owner would normally age, the portrait appears to age instead. The owner of a <em>soul portrait</em> does not die of old age. If someone benefitting from this effect ceases to be the portrait's owner, she immediately gains all associated physical penalties from her current age, and her appearance changes appropriately; if the owner is past her maximum age, she withers and dies instantly.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">When scrutinized by magical means (such as <a href="../advancedClassGuide/spells/auraSight.html" ><em>aura sight</em></a>, <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/detectEvil.html#detect-evil" ><em>detect evil</em></a>, <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/detectMagic.html#detect-magic" ><em>detect magic</em></a>, or <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/discernLies.html#discern-lies" ><em>discern lies</em></a>), the owner gains the benefits of a special <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/misdirection.html#misdirection" ><em>misdirection</em></a> with no saving throw allowed for the would-be investigator. For the purposes of the <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/misdirection.html#misdirection" ><em>misdirection</em></a>, the <em>soul portrait</em> provides results as the owner would have when she first acquired the portrait. Unlike a normal <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/misdirection.html#misdirection" ><em>misdirection</em></a>, this effect is not limited to spells that detect her aura. Whenever it would be beneficial to her, the owner counts as her younger self for any spell or effect that gathers information. For instance, if she denies committing a crime she perpetrated after she commissioned the portrait, all forms of truth magic would reveal her denial as being true. Even spells like <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/detectThoughts.html" ><em>detect thoughts</em></a> would reveal the thoughts of her younger self.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">When the portrait's owner would take ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels, she takes no adverse effects until they would be fatal (though she continues to accrue them in the portrait), and her image on the <em>soul portrait</em> twists in horrific agony as if suffering for its owner. Whenever any of the accrued maladies would be fatal (such as a number of negative levels equal to the owner's Hit Dice), the owner immediately dies. The <em>soul portrait</em> can be healed of ability damage, ability drain, and negative levels to reduce the accrued maladies by any effects that would normally heal these maladies.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">When the owner of a <em>soul portrait</em> dies, her soul is pulled into the canvas and her likeness becomes a character in the background, leaving space for a new portrait. A creature can claim ownership over a <em>soul portrait</em> by commissioning an artist to paint her likeness over the original image. The new owner must be present and willing while the artist paints, and the artist must succeed at a DC 25 <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft"  >Craft</a> (painting) check to create a sufficient likeness for the artifact to accept the new owner. Once this happens, if the previous owner is still alive, she ceases to be the <em>soul portrait</em>'s owner and ages as described above. The portrait can't be cut, burned, or otherwise damaged, except as described in the destruction requirements below.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Destruction</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>soul portrait</em> can be destroyed only by its current owner. The owner must slay the artist who painted her likeness onto the portrait, and then use the same weapon to destroy the portrait.</p>

<p id = "stannum-crown" class= "stat-block-title">Stannum Crown</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> head; <b>CL</b> 15th; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Though polished to a silvery gleam, the metal of this velvet-capped crown is simple tin. Occult scholars believe the first <em>stannum crowns</em> were created by a mad psychic king who had become convinced that entities from other planes were watching and plotting against him.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The crown is powered by its wearer's paranoia and mistrust, using them to grant the wearer immunity to mind-affecting effects and divinations that gather information about him. The wearer can't lower this immunity without removing the crown. Donning a <em>stannum crown</em> saps the wearer's mind, imposing a &ndash;2 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Removing the crown negates the penalty, but the wearer's enhanced paranoia makes him unwilling to doff the headdress. He can try to remove the crown once per day by attempting a Will save (DC = 25 + the number of consecutive days the crown has been worn). Once the DC becomes 35 or higher, the wearer's paranoia has progressed to the point where he no longer treats any other creature as an ally and attempts saving throws against even harmless spells and abilities. At this point, a natural 20 is not an automatic success on the saving throw to remove the crown, and the wearer never counts as a willing target for the purposes of another's spell or ability, even when he is unconscious. Other creatures can't remove the crown by force; only the wearer can take it off.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Destruction</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>stannum crown</em> can be destroyed only by placing it on the head of a sentient being who is truly incapable of mistrust. This destroys the crown, but leaves the creature with the powers and drawbacks of the crown, forever unable to remove or ameliorate them.</p>

<p id = "thought-record" class= "stat-block-title">Thought Record</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 15th; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong divination</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Though this tube resembles a simple copper pipe, its exotic metal reshapes the flow of time itself. A <em>thought record</em> measures 1 foot in length, and despite its light weight, it resists sudden acceleration as if it were a heavy, massive tree trunk. Intricate patterns are etched inside the tube, constantly shifting into new configurations that never repeat. <em>Thought records</em> store and replay memories, absorbing the entirety of a person's experience in an instant. These memories remain in the <em>thought record</em> indefinitely and can't be altered, though subsequent recordings from the same individual can be added. <em>Thought records</em> absorb such imprints unpredictably, with no indication of when the artifact will trigger or how to activate it deliberately. When the <em>thought record</em> records a life, its etched metal surface fades, appearing instead as a tiny window into a cosmic starscape. No known limit exists as to how many sets of memories a single <em>thought record</em> can hold.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Memories stored in a <em>thought record</em> can be used along with reality-altering magic such as <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/miracle.html" ><em>miracle</em></a> or <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/wish.html" ><em>wish</em></a> to bring back those irrevocably lost to death. Opinions differ on whether this amounts to an exotic <a href="../coreRulebook/spells/resurrection.html#resurrection" ><em>resurrection</em></a> or if it overwrites a newborn soul with the experiences of another.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>thought record</em> can allow its holder to experience portions of another's life in an instant. It is unclear what act triggers this replay, though most commonly it happens immediately when a creature first touches the device. When the <em>thought record</em> replays the past, the holder experiences the memories stored in the device not just as though she were present, but as if she were consciously making the choices herself.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Occult researchers speculate that <em>thought records</em> create conduits to the Akashic Record, and that experiencing memories stored within such a rod brings the consciousness of the holder into the past of another person, forming a gestalt of their minds. This gestalt experiences and affects the events as they took place, not merely when they were recorded. According to this theory, those experiencing a memory don't merely observe another's life&mdash;they take a role in shaping it. Some even suspect that a <em>thought record</em> can share memories that have yet to be stored. Whatever the explanation, the experiences of the <em>thought record</em> are so total that the creature living the memories suffers from any mental conditions suffered in the memories, such as insanity, damage to mental ability scores, and mind-affecting effects.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">Although a <em>thought record</em> can record the memories of many individuals, it almost never replays more than one creature's memories for a single user. Instead, later activations by that user replay other memories from the same creature, revealing more of its life. Repeated activation takes the user through another's life in bursts of instantaneous visions. The <em>thought record</em> does not replay recorded memories in sequential order. Instead, it skips back and forth across the life of the recorder, with later activations shedding light on earlier activations, regardless of their chronological order.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">The same temporal effects that let a <em>thought record</em> transmit memories across time render it nearly invulnerable to physical harm. Both the rod and the memories stored within resist any attempts at destruction or alteration.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Destruction</p>
<p class = "stat-block">A <em>thought record</em> can be destroyed by causing it to absorb the memories of a senile god.</p>
