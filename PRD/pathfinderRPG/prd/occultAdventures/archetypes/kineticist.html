<h1 id = "occult-adventures-kineticist-archetypes">Kineticist</h1>

<p>Some kineticists rule the elements by personality or discipline, or become paragons of healing or destruction.</p>

<h2 id = "blood-kineticist">Blood Kineticist (Archetype)</h2>
<p>To a blood kineticist, the water in a creature's blood is just like any other sort, and she uses that knowledge to brutal ends.</p>
<p><b>Blood Focus (Ex)</b>: A blood kineticist must choose water as her primary element and must choose water blast as her first simple blast. All of her infusions granted by this archetype work only on targets with blood and automatically fail if the target is immune to bleed damage.</p>
<p><b>Wrack (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a blood kineticist can use her abilities to wrack a target within 30 feet, harming the target by manipulating its blood from the inside. The target takes half the normal damage of the blood kineticist's blast, and can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce that amount to 1/4 normal damage, but the damage is untyped and ignores damage reduction. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion.</p>
<p><b>Bleeding Infusion (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a blood kineticist can infuse her blasts with a vicious power that causes internal or external bleeding. On a failed Fortitude save, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every die of the blast's damage. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the bleed damage from bleeding infusion on the same blast. This is a 2nd-level substance infusion that costs 2 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.</p>
<p><b>Blood Tell (Sp)</b>: At 6th level, a blood kineticist's connection to blood allows her to learn much from the blood of another. This works as <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/spells/bloodBiography.html#blood-biography-" ><em>blood biography</em></a>, except the blood kineticist suddenly knows the information, rather than having it appear on a parchment. This is a 3rd-level utility wild talent and costs 0 points of burn. She can accept 1 point of burn to reduce the casting time to a standard action instead of 1 minute. This ability replaces the 6th-level utility wild talent.</p>
<p><b>Blood Blast (Su)</b>: The first time a blood kineticist selects water with expanded element, she doesn't gain the cold simple blast or the ice composite blast; instead, she gains the blood composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. A blood blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning damage. It is associated with the same infusions as the water blast. If the blood kineticist selects water with expanded element a second time, she gains the cold simple blast and ice composite blast as normal. This ability alters expanded element.</p>
<p><b>Blood Throw (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a blood kineticist gains the foe throw infusion as a bonus infusion, and can use it with the water element on water and blood blasts, in addition to its normal associated element and blast. This ability replaces the 8th-level utility wild talent.</p>
<p><b>Gut-Wrenching Infusion (Su)</b>: At 9th level, a blood kineticist can infuse her blasts with the ability to manipulate her opponent's insides to the point of impairing their function. On a failed Fortitude save, the target is sickened for 1 minute. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the sickened condition from gut-wrenching infusion on the same blast. This is a 4th-level substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 9th-level infusion.</p>
<p><b>Vampiric Infusion (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a blood kineticist can drain the vitality from her enemy's blood to restore her own. If her blast hits (or the enemy fails its saving throw against a blast without an attack roll) the blood kineticist can activate the kinetic healer utility wild talent on herself by accepting its burn cost; she doesn't need to take an action to do so. If she doesn't possess the kinetic healer utility wild talent, she can still use this ability, but it heals only half as much. This is a 5th-level substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 11th-level infusion.</p>
<p><b>Blood Mastery (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a blood kineticist no longer ages and can't be magically aged. She doesn't take penalties to her ability scores for aging and removes any such penalties she already possesses. She still accrues age bonuses as normal, but she doesn't die of old age when her time would be up. Because of her utter control over her own blood, she is immune to bleed, injected poisons, injury diseases, and the sickened and nauseated conditions unless she chooses to be affected. This ability replaces omnikinesis.</p>

<h2 id = "elemental-annihilator">Elemental Annihilator (Archetype) </h2>
<p>For some kineticists, nothing in life is as sweet as destruction and pain. Elemental annihilators pursue only uses of their powers that harm others.</p>
<p><b>Devastating Infusion (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an elemental annihilator can either shoot her kinetic blast at a target within 30 feet or make a single melee attack as if she were using kinetic blade as an attack action. For this attack, the elemental annihilator's base attack bonus from her kineticist levels is equal to her full kineticist level. A devastating infusion always deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + the elemental annihilator's Constitution modifier, regardless of the annihilator's class level or use of composite blasts. When making a melee attack with devastating infusion, the elemental annihilator doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and if she uses two hands, the attack's damage is equal to 1d8 + 1-1/2 times her Constitution modifier. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with any physical blast (but not energy blasts). Unlike with kinetic blade, the elemental annihilator can use Vital Strike with devastating infusion. The damage bonus from elemental overflow doesn't apply to devastating infusion's damage rolls. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion and the basic utility wild talent normally granted by selecting an element.</p>
<p><b>Dampened Versatility (Ex)</b>: An elemental annihilator can never gain utility wild talents.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: At 2nd level, an elemental annihilator can select a bonus feat from the following list: Deadly Aim, Double Slice, Point-Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. Rapid Shot and Two-Weapon Fighting can be used with a kinetic blast only if the annihilator also possesses flurry of devastation (see below). She gains an additional bonus feat at 8th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels. At 8th level, she can also select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Weapon Specialization. At 10th level, she can also select Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Improved Precise Shot, and Two-Weapon Rend. An elemental annihilator doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats to select them as bonus feats. This ability replaces the 2nd-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level utility wild talents.</p>
<p><b>Increased Range (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, an elemental annihilator gains the extended range infusion. At 9th level, she gains the extreme range infusion. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 9th-level infusions.</p>
<p><b>Ever-Present Threat (Su)</b>: At 4th level, an elemental annihilator threatens all foes within her natural reach. If anyone provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can form her melee devastating infusion and make the attack, after which the weapon disappears. This ability replaces the 4th-level utility wild talent.</p>
<p><b>Blast Training (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, an elemental annihilator gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her devastating infusion form infusion. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.</p>
<p><b>Flurry of Devastation (Su)</b>: At 6th level, an elemental annihilator can make a full attack of devastating infusions against targets within 120 feet as a full-attack action. Each individual attack deals damage as a devastating infusion. This is a 3rd-level form infusion that costs 1 point of burn and can be used with the same blast types as devastating infusion. Abilities such as Rapid Shot and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/haste.html" ><em>haste</em></a> that grant additional attacks apply normally to this full attack. If she makes only melee attacks with her flurry of devastation, she can use the Two-Weapon Fighting feats (unlike with the kinetic blade wild talent), but ranged devastating infusions do not work with Two-Weapon Fighting. For the elemental annihilator's off-hand attacks with Two-Weapon Fighting, she adds half her Constitution modifier to the damage (increasing to her full Constitution modifier if she has Double Slice). Though she can normally mix melee and ranged attacks with her flurry of devastation, she can't do so when she uses Two-Weapon Fighting. She can never use metakinesis or substance infusions with flurry of devastation. This ability replaces the 6th-, 12th-, and 16th-level utility wild talents.</p>
<p><b>Omnicide (Su)</b>: At 20th level, an elemental annihilator can unleash omnicide, a unique physical composite blast. Omnicide deals 10d6+10 points of bludgeoning damage, 10d6+10 points of cold damage, 10d6+10 points of electricity damage, 10d6+10 points of fire damage, and 10d6+10 points of force damage, and counts as a blast of all five elements. Omnicide costs 4 points of burn, which can be reduced by composite specialization as normal. This ability replaces omnikinesis and the 20th-level utility wild talent.</p>

<h2 id = "elemental-ascetic">Elemental Ascetic (Archetype)</h2>
<p>Combining the elemental powers of a kineticist with the rigid physical discipline of a monk, an elemental ascetic channels his powers through his body to enhance himself in combat.</p>
<p><b>Elemental Flurry (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an elemental ascetic gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He gains the kinetic fist form infusion and it costs 0 points of burn instead of 1 point of burn. When using the kinetic fist form infusion with a full attack, he can make a flurry of blows as the monk class feature. He must use only his fists to make this flurry, no matter what other abilities he possesses. Like a monk, he can use this ability only when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered. He can't use his kinetic blast without a form infusion, nor can he ever use his kinetic blast with the chain, extended range, extreme range, foe throw, flurry of blasts, many throw, or snake form infusions, or with any other form infusion that requires a ranged attack roll or ranged touch attack roll. This ability alters kinetic blast and replaces elemental overflow.</p>
<p><b>Elemental Wisdom (Su)</b>: An elemental ascetic can use his Wisdom modifier instead of his Constitution modifier to determine the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the duration of wild talents with a Constitution-based duration, and his bonus on concentration checks for wild talents. This ability alters the key ability scores of wild talents.</p>
<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered, an elemental ascetic adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD. These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the elemental ascetic is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels the elemental ascetic possesses beyond 2nd. The elemental ascetic's kineticist levels stack with monk levels for the purpose of determining when the bonus increases. An elemental ascetic can never take the expanded defense utility wild talent. This ability replaces elemental defense.</p>
<p><b>Powerful Fist (Su)</b>: At 5th level, an elemental ascetic can accept 2 additional points of burn when using kinetic fist to increase that infusion's damage dice from d6s to d8s. At 9th level, he can instead accept 3 additional points of burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d10s. At 13th level, he can instead accept 4 additional points of burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d12s. All of these options count as burn from a form infusion and can thus be reduced by infusion specialization. This ability replaces the 5th-, 9th-, and 13th-level infusions.</p>

<h2 id = "kinetic-chirurgeon">Kinetic Chirurgeon (Archetype)</h2>
<p>While any hydrokineticist or telekineticist can learn the rudiments of healing, some kineticists are virtuosos of the curative arts.</p>
<p><b>Kinetic Chirurgery (Su)</b>: A kinetic chirurgeon must select either aether or water as her primary element. She gains kinetic healer as a bonus wild talent at 1st level. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the kinetic chirurgeon can select any one paladin mercy that a paladin of that level could select. Each time she uses kinetic healer, she can apply one of these mercies to the target of the healing. A kinetic chirurgeon can never use infusions. This ability replaces infusions.</p>
<p><b>Metahealer (Su)</b>: Starting at 5th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can apply any one of the following metahealer abilities to her kinetic healer wild talent instead of using her mercies. At 5th level, she can choose to roll one additional die when using kinetic healer. This increases to two additional dice at 11th level, and to three additional dice at 17th level. At 9th level, she can choose to bring an ally who died within 1 round back from the dead; this functions similarly to the <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/breathOfLife.html#breath-of-life" ><em>breath of life</em></a> spell. The ally regains the normal number of hit points from kinetic healer. An ally revived in this way takes 1 additional point of burn, beyond the normal 1 point of burn that either the kinetic chirurgeon or the ally must accept as a cost of the kinetic healer wild talent. At 13th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can choose to use kinetic healer on herself as a swift action. At 17th level, she can choose to heal both herself and another target with the same use of kinetic healer, although in that case, both she and her target must each accept 1 point of burn, instead of only one of them needing to do so as normal for kinetic healer. Regardless of her level, the kinetic chirurgeon can apply only one metahealer ability to a single use of kinetic healer. For instance, she could not bring back a dead ally and also roll extra dice for healing. This ability replaces metakinesis and infusion specialization.</p>
<p><b>Healing Buffer (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a kinetic chirurgeon's internal buffer has double the usual maximum size, and she can use it only when she would accept points of burn for the kinetic healer wild talent. This ability alters internal buffer.</p>

<h2 id = "overwhelming-soul">Overwhelming Soul (Archetype)</h2>
<p>Some kineticists have such a powerful personality that they can seize control of their element with their minds alone, without endangering their bodies.</p>
<p><b>Mind Over Matter (Ex)</b>: An overwhelming soul uses her Charisma modifier instead of her Constitution modifier to determine her damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the duration of wild talents with a Constitution-based duration, her bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and the other Constitution-based effects of all her wild talents. She adds <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> to her list of kineticist class skills. This ability alters the kineticist's class skills and the key ability score of wild talents.</p>
<p><b>Mental Prowess (Su)</b>: An overwhelming soul's mind is strong enough to protect her body from the stress of channeling the elements. However, in exchange, she is unable to push her limits quite as far as other kineticists. She can't choose to accept burn, though she can use wild talents with a burn cost if she can reduce that cost to 0 points with abilities such as gather power and infusion specialization. If she would be forced to accept burn against her will (for example, if she fails a concentration check), instead of taking burn she takes 1 temporary negative level, which never kills her and can't be removed with <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/restoration.html" ><em>restoration</em></a> or <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/restoration.html#restoration-greater" ><em>greater restoration</em></a>, but which disappears automatically after 24 hours. At 6th level, once per day, she can reduce the total burn cost of any wild talent by 1. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability alters burn and replaces internal buffer.</p>
<p><b>Overwhelming Power (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an overwhelming soul gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her kinetic blasts. The damage bonus doesn't apply to kinetic blade, kinetic whip, or other infusions that don't apply the damage bonus from elemental overflow. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. This ability replaces elemental overflow.</p>
