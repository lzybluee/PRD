<h1 id = "occult-adventures-archetypes">Other Class Archetypes</h1>

<h2 id = "promethean-disciple">Promethean Disciple (Alchemist Discovery)</h2>
<p>Some alchemists dabble in the art of construct creation.</p>
<p><em>Promethean Disciple</em>: An alchemist with this discovery learns how to craft constructs by way of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains <a href = "../../bestiary/monsterFeats.html#craft-construct" >Craft Construct</a> as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements. The alchemist substitutes his number of ranks in <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) for his total caster level and must use <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) to create the construct. The DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that the alchemist does not have access to. However, the alchemist can use extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>

<h2 id = "ectochymist">Ectochymist (Alchemist Archetype)</h2>
<p>Ectochymists study the effects of alchemy on soul and spirit, focusing on fighting ghosts and other incorporeal creatures.</p>
<p><b>Class Skills</b>: An ectochymist adds <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) to his list of class skills. This alters the alchemist's class skills.</p>
<p><b>Ectoplasmic Blanche (Su)</b>: An ectochymist can alchemically treat a melee weapon so that it deals full damage to incorporeal creatures. The process requires a full-round action and lasts until the next time that weapon is used to make an attack. An ectochymist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces bombs.</p>
<p><b>Cool-Headed (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an ectochymist gains a +2 bonus on saves against death, fear, and negative energy effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p>
<p><b>Advanced Ectochymistry (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a weapon coated in an ectochymist's ectoplasmic blanche also deals full damage to haunts. This ability replaces poison use.</p>
<p><b>Swift Ectochymistry (Su)</b>: At 6th level, an ectochymist can use ectoplasmic blanche on one of his own weapons as a swift action. When coated on a weapon wielded by the ectochymist, ectoplasmic blanche lasts for a number of attacks equal to the ectochymist's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 attack). This ability replaces swift poisoning.</p>
<p><b>Ghost Trap (Su)</b>: At 8th level, an ectochymist can throw a trap to capture an incorporeal creature of up to 1 Hit Die per alchemist level he possesses. As a standard action, the ectochymist can expend a use of ectoplasmic blanche to coat the inside of a container with his blanche and throw it at an incorporeal creature as a ranged touch attack. If he hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape the trap (DC = 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier). If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel until someone breaks or opens that vessel. The ghost trap automatically survives being thrown at the incorporeal creature, but otherwise is only as durable as the vessel (normally hardness 5, 1 hp for a glass bottle).This ability replaces the 8th-level alchemist discovery.</p>
<p><b>Ectochymical Analysis (Sp)</b>: At 10th level, an ectochymist can use alchemical processes to uncover esoteric knowledge from a haunted area that would normally require divinations to ascertain. This process takes 10 minutes and expends one use of ectoplasmic blanche. Treat this effect as <a href="../../advancedClassGuide/spells/speakWithHaunt.html" ><em>speak with haunt</em></a> with a saving throw DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the ectochymist's class level + the ectochymist's Charisma modifier and a caster level equal to the ectochymist's class level. Because the ectochymist is performing an analysis to answer his questions and not speaking with the haunt directly, he uses <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) rather than <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> to oppose any <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> checks the spirit might attempt in order to mislead him. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p>
<p><b>Discoveries</b>: The following discoveries complement the ectochymist archetype: alchemical simulacrum, cognatogen, grand cognatogen, greater alchemical simulacrum, and mummification.</p>

<h2 id = "promethean-alchemist">Promethean Alchemist (Alchemist archetype)</h2>
<p>Obsessed with discovering the origins of life, promethean alchemists build constructs they gradually endow with life.</p>
<p><b>Craft Construct</b>: At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the promethean disciple discovery (see above). This ability replaces Brew Potion and Throw Anything.</p>
<p><b>Homunculus Companion (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the service of a homunculus companion. The means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic than normal and require investiture of the promethean alchemist's own life essence into the homunculus. This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection. While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi's loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters' honor. A homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master's. A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator's blood per Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus. Performing this ritual takes 1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough blood at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep chilled blood samples in storage just in case). A promethean alchemist can't take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries. This ability replaces bombs and mutagen.</p>
<p><b>Discoveries</b>: The following discoveries complement this archetype: alchemical simulacrum, doppelganger simulacrum, and greater alchemical simulacrum.</p>

<h3>Homunculus Companion Base Statistics</h3>
<p>A homunculus companion has the following features, as described in the table above.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: This is the homunculus's master's alchemist level.</p>
<p><b>HD</b>: This is the homunculus's total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice. The homunculus doesn't have a Constitution score, but it gains bonus hit points based on its size.</p>
<p><b>BAB</b>: This is the base attack bonus of the homunculus, which is equal to its number of Hit Dice.</p>
<p><b>Saves</b>: These are the base saving throw bonuses of the homunculus.</p>
<p><b>Skills</b>: This entry lists the homunculus's total number of skill ranks. A homunculus with a high Intelligence score modifies these totals as normal (the homunculus gains a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + its Intelligence modifier per HD). A homunculus can't have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.</p>
<p><em>Homunculus Class Skills</em>: The following skills are class skills for a homunculus: <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> (Cha), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (Int), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana) (Int), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> (Wis), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> (Wis), and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, a promethean alchemist can choose two additional skills to be class skills for his homunculus.</p>
<p><b>Feats</b>: This is the total number of feats the homunculus has. A homunculus can select any feats it qualifies for, but must possess the appropriate appendages in order to use some feats.</p>
<p><b>Str/Dex Bonus</b>: Add this modifier to the homunculus's Strength and Dexterity.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: As the homunculus increases in power, it gains the special abilities described below.</p>
<p><em>Darkvision (Ex)</em>: The homunculus has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p><em>Low-Light Vision (Ex)</em>: Homunculi see twice as far as humans in dim light.</p>
<p><em>Sympathetic Alchemy (Su)</em>: The bond between a promethean alchemist and his homunculus is so close that the alchemist's extracts function for the homunculus as if it were the alchemist, allowing the homunculus companion to benefit from extracts without the alchemist needing the infusion discovery. The homunculus is treated as a humanoid or a construct&mdash;whichever is more beneficial&mdash;for the purposes of what extracts can affect it. Additionally, the homunculus can prepare its master's extracts from his formula book for him each day, as long as it's within the range of its telepathic link.</p>
<p><em>Telepathic Link (Su)</em>: A homunculus can't initially speak, but shares a telepathic link with its creator. It knows what its master knows and can convey to him everything it sees and hears, out to a range of 1,500 feet.</p>
<p><em>Weapon and Armor Proficiency (Ex)</em>: A homunculus is proficient with simple weapons, but not armor or shields.</p>
<p><em>Evasion (Ex)</em>: At 3rd level, if a homunculus is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw.</p>
<p><em>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</em>: The homunculus adds 1 to one of its ability scores at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Speech (Ex)</em>: At 6th level, the homunculus gains the ability to speak any languages it knows.</p>
<p><em>Spell Resistance (Su)</em>: At 9th level, the homunculus gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its master's alchemist level.</p>
<p><em>Improved Evasion (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, when subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the homunculus takes no damage if it succeeds at the saving throw and only half damage if it fails the saving throw.</p>
<p><b>Homunculus Starting Statistics</b></p>
<p><b>Size</b> Small; <b>Speed</b> 20 ft., fly 30 ft. (poor); <b>AC</b> +2 natural armor; <b>Attack</b> bite (1d4); <b>Ability</b> <b>Scores</b> Str 10, Dex 15, Con &mdash;, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 7; <b>Special </b><b>Qualities</b> darkvision, low-light vision; <b>Languages</b> Common (can't speak).</p>
<p><b>4th-Level Advancement</b></p>

<h2 id = "flesheater">Flesheater (Barbarian Archetype)</h2>
<p>A flesheater eats flesh to create a spiritual bond between herself and the consumed creature, allowing her to take on aspects of the creature that served as the meal.</p>
<p><b>Rage</b>: In additional to the standard bonuses and penalties of rage, a flesheater takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Intelligence while raging. The additional benefits and penalties from a flesheater's abilities last only as long as her rage does, and she cannot use these abilities if they would bring the total penalty to Intelligence to an amount equal to or greater than her Intelligence score. This ability alters the rage ability.</p>
<p><b>One Flesh (Su)</b>: At 2nd level when entering a rage, a flesheater can spend an additional round of rage and take an additional &ndash;2 penalty to Intelligence to take on a single ability of the valid consumed creature whose flesh she ate most recently. For the purpose of this ability, a valid consumed creature is any dead animal, dragon, humanoid, or magical beast that died and was consumed by the flesheater within the past 24 hours. She can choose any ability listed under <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/beastShape.html#beast-shape-i" ><em>beast shape I</em></a>, as long as the creature possessed that ability. At 5th level, the flesheater can take on any number of the creature's abilities that are listed under <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/beastShape.html#beast-shape-i" ><em>beast shape I</em></a>. At 8th level, the flesheater can instead take on one of the creature's abilities listed under <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/beastShape.html#beast-shape-ii" ><em>beast shape II</em></a>. The flesheater's appearance alters to resemble the consumed creature, but she does not change shape. This is a polymorph effect. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and the 2nd- and 8th-level rage powers.</p>
<p><b>Unbound Rage (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a flesheater can draw in mass from the Ethereal Plane to enlarge herself when she enters a rage, as long as the creature whose flesh she last consumed was at least one size category larger than her base size. Unbound rage affects her as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/enlargePerson.html#enlarge-person" ><em>enlarge person</em></a>, except she receives a +4 size bonus to Strength and an additional &ndash;2 penalty to Intelligence. This ability replaces greater rage.</p>
<p><b>Feast (Su)</b>: At 14th level, a flesheater can use her one flesh and unbound rage abilities to emulate any one valid consumed creature of her choice, rather than only the one she consumed most recently. This ability replaces the 14th-level rage power.</p>
<p><b>Unbound Form (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a flesheater can use her one flesh ability to assume the shape of a valid consumed creature. This ability functions as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/alterSelf.html#alter-self" ><em>alter self</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/beastShape.html#beast-shape-iv" ><em>beast shape IV</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/formOfTheDragon.html#form-of-the-dragon-iii" ><em>form of the dragon III</em></a>, or <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/giantForm.html#giant-form-ii" ><em>giant form II</em></a>, as appropriate. This is a polymorph effect. This ability replaces mighty rage.</p>
<p><b>Rage Powers</b>: The following rage powers complement the flesheater archetype: animal fury, beast totem (any), inspire ferocity, internal fortitude, and terrifying howl.</p>

<h2 id = "phrenologist">Phrenologist (Bard Archetype) </h2>
<p>The phrenologist is an expert at reading creatures' skulls, and he learns to use this knowledge to his benefit.</p>
<p><b>Phrenological Knowledge (Ex)</b>: A phrenologist is an expert at reading creatures' skulls. He gains Psychic Sensitivity* as a bonus feat, and he can use the phrenology skill unlock even if he is untrained in <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana). He adds half his class level (minimum 1) on all <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana) checks for the phrenology occult skill unlock. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Skull-Versed (Ex)</b>: Starting at 2nd level, a phrenologist can use knowledge gleaned from a creature's skull to tailor a performance. All creatures on which the phrenologist has successfully used his phrenology skill unlock take a &ndash;2 penalty on all saving throws against the phrenologist's bardic performances. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
<p><b>Phrenological Savant</b>: At 10th level, a phrenologist gains either Psychic Maestro* or Psychic Virtuoso* as a bonus feat. If he chooses Psychic Maestro, he must select phrenology as one of his two skill unlocks to use an additional time. This ability replaces jack-of-all-trades.</p>
<p><b>Bardic Performance</b>: A phrenologist gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Skull Sonata (Su)</em>: At 1st level, a phrenologist learns to use the resonance of other creatures' skulls to increase sonic damage. All enemies within 30 feet of the phrenologist that have skulls take an amount of additional sonic damage equal to half the phrenologist's bard level (minimum 1) each time they take sonic damage. Skull sonata relies on audible components. This ability replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>In Your Head (Sp)</em>: At 3rd level, a phrenologist can use his performance to send his own senses into another's skull, as the spell <em>witness</em> (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phrenologist's class level + his Charisma modifier). At 11th level, this performance's duration increases to 10 minutes per bard level, and at 19th level, the duration increases to 1 hour per bard level. In your head relies on audible components. This ability replaces inspire competence.</p>
<p><em>Fingers of Fascination (Su)</em>: When a phrenologist uses the fascinate bardic performance, he can send forth psychic fingers along with his performance, allowing him to study one of the fascinated creatures with his phrenology skill unlock without touching its head physically and without it being helpless, willing, or paralyzed. This does not spend his daily use of the phrenology skill unlock. This ability alters fascinate.</p>

<h2 id = "silver-balladeer">Silver Balladeer (Bard Archetype)</h2>
<p>The bright purity of silver makes beautiful music, and its vibrations are also anathema to unnatural creatures. Some bards use a mixture of silver-stringed instruments and esoteric knowledge to battle the dark forces of the world.</p>
<p><b>Alignment</b>: A silver balladeer must have a good alignment. This ability alters alignment.</p>
<p><b>Bardic Performance</b>: A silver balladeer gains the bardic performances listed below. These bardic performances all require the use of a silver or silver-stringed instrument, which costs twice as much as a normal masterwork instrument.</p>
<p><em>Break Curse (Su)</em>: At 6th level, a silver balladeer can suppress a single curse affecting an ally within 30 feet that is able to see and hear her. Each round the silver balladeer uses break curse, she attempts a <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/perform.html#perform" >Perform</a> check against the original DC of the curse. If successful, she suppresses the curse for 1 round. After she has suppressed the curse for 4 consecutive rounds, she can attempt a caster level check to remove the curse as if she had cast <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/removeCurse.html" ><em>remove curse</em></a>. This ability replaces suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Holy Vibration (Su)</em>: At 9th level, a silver balladeer can spend a round of bardic performance to make a single door or a window within 30 feet resonate with a holy vibration. Undead and creatures with the evil subtype are unable to open a door or window affected in this way (as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/arcaneLock.html#arcane-lock" ><em>arcane lock</em></a>) for 10 minutes per bard level. If such a creature has the incorporeal subtype, it is unable to move through the affected door or window, or through any walls, floors, or ceilings within 20 feet of it. Incorporeal creatures can attempt Charisma checks to break through areas warded by holy vibration, using the same break DC as for the object the creature is trying to move through. This ability replaces inspire greatness.</p>
<p><em>Mass Break Curse (Su)</em>: At 18th level, a silver balladeer can suppress all curses among any number of allies within 30 feet when using break curse. Every 4 consecutive rounds of using this performance, the silver balladeer can attempt a caster level check to remove a single curse on a single ally affected by this performance, as if she had cast <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/removeCurse.html" ><em>remove curse</em></a>. This ability replaces mass suggestion.</p>
<p><b>Pure Heart (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a silver balladeer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against curses, hexes, and charm effects. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
<p><b>Silver Mastery (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a silver balladeer treats silver weapons as if they were also cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Also, alchemical silver weapons do not impose a penalty on damage rolls when wielded by a silver balladeer, and a silver balladeer gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls made with mithral weapons. This ability replaces the 2nd-level versatile performance.</p>

<h2 id = "order-of-the-eastern-star">Order of the Eastern Star (Cavalier Order)</h2>
<p>This cavalier order exists to keep dangerous secrets hidden from the world and secretly protect the world against unimaginable threats from beyond the mortal realms. These cavaliers scout and observe, concerning themselves not with the trivial pursuit of morality, but rather with ensuring the survival of society itself.</p>
<p><b>Edicts</b>: The cavalier must preserve the secrets of his order while acting to protect civilization against occult threats. He must thwart the schemes of otherworldly horrors and must give his order a full accounting of any potential threats.</p>
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Whenever a cavalier of the order of the eastern star issues a challenge, he receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 insight bonus on saves against the attacks and abilities of the target of his challenge. He must be wearing light armor and carrying no more than a light load to receive these bonuses. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.</p>
<p><b>Skills</b>: A cavalier belonging to the order of the eastern star adds <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana) and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (planes) to his class skills. He can attempt <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana) and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (planes) checks untrained. If he has ranks in these skills, as long as a check involves knowledge of the occult or supernatural, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>
<p><b>Feats</b>: A cavalier of this order gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><b>Order Abilities</b>: A cavalier belonging to this order gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>
<p><em>Guarded (Ex)</em>: At 2nd level, the cavalier gains DR 1/&mdash; and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws when wearing light armor or no armor and fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this DR increases by 1. He loses the benefits of this ability if carrying a medium or heavier load.</p>
<p><em>Pierce the Guard (Ex)</em>: At 8th level, when attacking with a light or one-handed weapon, the cavalier ignores the penalty for fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise on his first melee attack roll each round. If fighting with two weapons, he ignores the penalty for the first attack with each weapon, as long as the off-hand weapon is a light weapon. The cavalier can't use this ability with double weapons.</p>
<p><em>One Purpose (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, the cavalier's mount shares the benefits of the cavalier's guarded ability as long as both are wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. The cavalier must fight defensively or use Combat Expertise to grant these benefits, but the mount need not. In addition, the mount gains all the benefits of the cavalier's challenge, regardless of what barding it wears.</p>

<h2 id = "order-of-the-shroud">Order of the Shroud (Cavalier Order)</h2>
<p>Cavaliers of this order seek out and destroy undead and those who harbor or create them. They scour old crypts, graveyards, and battlefields to bring eternal rest.</p>
<p><b>Edicts</b>: The cavalier must protect the common folk from the scourge of the undead. He must seek out and destroy the restless dead and give aid to those haunted by them. He must protect those who cannot defend themselves, and root out sources that birth the corruption of life and death.</p>
<p><b> Challenge</b>: Whenever an order of the shroud cavalier issues a challenge to an undead creature, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge for 1 minute. The bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.</p>
<p><b>Skills</b>: An order of the shroud cavalier adds <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (local) (Int) and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the shroud cavalier can attempt <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) checks untrained. If he has ranks in that skill, as long as a <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) check involves undead or haunts, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>
<p><b>Order Abilities</b>: A cavalier belonging to the order of the shroud gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Shield (Su)</em>: At 2nd level, the cavalier can call upon the spirits of the fallen for protection. Once per day as an immediate action when attacked by an undead target of his challenge, the cavalier can gain a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier to his AC against that attack. The cavalier must decide to use this ability before the attack roll.</p>
<p><em>Destroyer of the Undead (Su)</em>: At 8th level, the cavalier's weapons are treated as having the cavalier's alignment for the purpose of overcoming the damage reduction of undead creatures. Against an undead target of his challenge, the cavalier automatically overcomes all damage reduction that undead possesses.</p>
<p><em>Stand Against Darkness (Ex or Su)</em>: At 15th level, the cavalier can take revenge on undead that dare strike him or those he seeks to protect. Whenever an undead creature that is the subject of his challenge hits the cavalier or an adjacent ally with a melee attack, the creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks of opportunity provoked as a result of this ability. If an undead subject of the cavalier's challenge threatens a critical hit against the cavalier, the cavalier gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier against the confirmation roll. This bonus functions as a supernatural ability.</p>

<h2 id = "ghost-rider">Ghost Rider (Cavalier Archetype)</h2>
<p>Ghost riders are conflicted warriors who use the powers of the phantasmal dead even while seeking out and banishing the corruption of undeath from plagued communities. Their strange abilities mark them as outsiders and stoic loners, and they stay in one place only long enough to help the afflicted before riding off to unknown destinations.</p>
<p><b>Ghost Mount (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a ghost rider gains the ability to manifest a special mount of conjured ectoplasm rather than one of flesh and bone. This spectral companion functions like a spiritualist's phantom companion, using the ghost rider's cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier's normal mount options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.</p>
<p>The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist's etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount. The mount shares the cavalier's alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its master's verbal commands and gains the phantom's link ability. The ghost mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following skills: <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb" >Climb</a> (Str), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> (Wis), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> (Str). The ghost rider's ghost mount does not gain the share spells, deliver touch spells, or incorporeal flight abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional focus abilities.</p>
<p>The ghost rider does not take an armor check penalty on <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/ride.html#ride" >Ride</a> checks while riding her mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><em>Ghost Mount Starting Statistics</em>: <b>Type</b> animal (phantom); <b>Size</b> one size category larger than the ghost rider; <b>Speed</b> 50 ft.; <b>AC</b> +4 natural armor; <b>Attack</b> bite (1d4), 2 hooves (1d6; this is a secondary natural attack); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str 16, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.</p>
<p>This ability replaces mount.</p>
<p><b>Frightful Gaze (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a ghost rider can use this ability on opponents within 30 feet as a standard action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider's next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider's gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider's class level + the ghost rider's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost rider's frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician.</p>
<p><b>Fearless (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a ghost rider becomes immune to fear. Each ally within 10 feet of the ghost rider gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the ghost rider is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p>
<p><b>Spirited Mount (Su)</b>: At 5th level, the ghost rider's mount ignores difficult terrain. At 8th level, it gains the ability to use <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/waterWalk.html#water-walk" ><em>water walk</em></a> at will. This ability replaces expert trainer and banner.</p>
<p><b>Ghost Wind (Su)</b>: At 11th level, the ghost rider's ghost mount can use <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/airWalk.html#air-walk" ><em>air walk</em></a> (as the spell, no action required) at will for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. At 14th level, the mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> skill checks equal to the ghost rider's class level. This ability replaces mighty charge and greater banner.</p>

<h2 id = "sensate">Sensate (Fighter Archetype)</h2>
<p>A sensate perceives battle through senses beyond mortal ken, anticipating his opponents' movements before they even begin to act. As long as he keeps his focus about him, he fights with a skill rivaling that of the finest masters-at-arms.</p>
<p><b>Skills</b>: The sensate's class skills are <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb" >Climb</a> (Str), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/craft.html#craft" >Craft</a> (Int), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> (Wis), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/profession.html#profession" >Profession</a> (Wis), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/ride.html#ride" >Ride</a> (Dex), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> (Wis), <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> (Str). This replaces the fighter's class skills.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Sensates are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). This replaces the fighter's weapon and armor proficiency.</p>
<p><b>Guarded Senses (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a sensate gains a +1 bonus on saves against sonic effects, figments, glamers, patterns, gaze attacks, and scent-based attacks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the sensate possesses beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a sensate gains uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
<p><b>Centered Senses (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a sensate can center his senses as a move action. While centered, a sensate gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A sensate loses his centered state if he gains the confused, dazed, fascinated, staggered, or stunned condition; falls unconscious; or fails a Will save. This ability replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a sensate gains improved uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p>
<p><b>Evasion (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a sensate gains evasion while using centered senses. This functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it is supernatural in nature and works regardless of the sensate's armor and encumbrance. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
<p><b>Steady (Su)</b>: At 15th level, a sensate can center himself as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
<p><b>Perfect Senses (Su)</b>: At 19th level, a sensate's senses reach perfection, and he can easily notice illusions and unseen foes by combining his senses. While centered, he gains the effects of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/trueSeeing.html#true-seeing" ><em>true seeing</em></a> as well as blindsense 60 feet. An unseen creature that makes no sound and leaves no scent (such as a creature under the effects of <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/invisibility.html" ><em>invisibility</em></a>, <em>silence</em>, and <a href="../../advancedPlayersGuide/spells/negateAroma.html#negate-aroma" ><em>negate aroma</em></a>) can still avoid both the <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/trueSeeing.html#true-seeing" ><em>true seeing</em></a> and the blindsense. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
<p><b>Precision (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a sensate rolls twice to confirm critical hits while centered, taking the more favorable result. Opponents must roll twice to confirm critical hits against him, taking the less favorable result. The latter ability does not function when the sensate is denied his Dexterity bonus. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>

<h2 id = "relic-hunter">Relic Hunter (Inquisitor Archetype)</h2>
<p>Some inquisitors specialize in the use and recovery of long-lost relics of their faiths, drawing forth divine might from the recovered items in order to restore their sanctity and wield these artifacts against the enemies of their gods.</p>
<p><b>Spells</b>: A relic hunter casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list, but her chosen relic schools (see Relics below) limit her to schools she knows, similar in function to an occultist's implements. Any spell or orison gained by the relic hunter has a relic component (see Relics below), and is not considered to be on the relic hunter's spell list until she selects its school though the relics alternate class feature. Once she chooses a school, all spells and orisons of that school are considered to be on the relic hunter's class spell list, allowing her to use spell trigger and spell completion magic items of those spells. A relic hunter's spells per day, daily spell allotment, Difficulty Class, and minimum Wisdom score requirements remain unchanged from the inquisitor's normal spellcasting class feature. This ability alters the inquisitor's spellcasting.</p>
<p><b>Relics (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a relic hunter gains the occultist's implements class feature and learns to use two occultist implement schools as relic schools. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the relic hunter learns to use one additional relic school drawn from the same source, gaining access to that school's resonant power and base focus power and opening up that school's focus powers for her to select. Like an occultist, a relic hunter can select the same school twice, but it is far less useful for her to do so.</p>
<p>Relics do not need to be magic items, and nonmagical relics do not take up a magic item slot. Relics that are not magic items are often of some religious significance to the relic hunter or her church, such as the battered shield of a saint, a bishop's robe, or the finger bone of a church martyr.</p>
<p>This ability replaces judgment.</p>
<p><b>Deific Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a relic hunter learns to invest divine power into her chosen relics. This acts like the <a href = "../classes/occultist.html" >occultist's focus powers and mental focus class features</a>, with the following adjustments.</p>
<p>Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier, and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to invest them with divine power. These points refresh at the start of each day.</p>
<p>At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those made available by her chosen schools. Whenever she gains a new relic school, she gains the base focus power of that school. In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she learns a new focus power selected from all of the powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows. She can use these focus powers only by expending points of deific focus. Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throws against a focus power is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's class level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier. She cannot select a focus power more than once. She uses her inquisitor level in place of an occultist level to qualify for focus powers.</p>
<p>This ability replaces domain, bane, greater bane, second judgment, and third judgment.</p>

<h2 id = "psychic-detective">Psychic Detective (Investigator Archetype)</h2>
<p>A psychic detective supplements her keen insight with occult skill to unravel mysteries both ordinary and supernatural.</p>
<p><b>Class Skills</b>: The psychic detective does not receive <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a>, <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb" >Climb</a>, or <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/perform.html#perform" >Perform</a> as class skills. This alters the investigator's class skills.</p>
<p><b>Spells</b>: A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class spell list and augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic Detective Spells). Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective's spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.</p>
<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast.</p>
<p>A psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic detective spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p>
<p><em>Psychic Detective Spells</em>: A psychic detective has the following spells on her spell list, in addition to psychic spells of 6th level or lower.</p>
<p>1st&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectChaos.html#detect-chaos" ><em>detect chaos</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectEvil.html#detect-evil" ><em>detect evil</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectGood.html#detect-good" ><em>detect good</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectLaw.html#detect-law" ><em>detect law</em></a>, <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/findTraps.html" ><em>find traps</em></a>.</p>
<p>3rd&mdash;<a href="../spells/calmSpirit.html#calm-spirit" ><em>calm spirit</em> </a>*, <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/daylight.html" ><em>daylight</em></a>.</p>
<p>4th&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/modifyMemory.html#modify-memory" ><em>modify memory</em></a>.</p>
<p>6th&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/banishment.html#banishment" ><em>banishment</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/momentOfPrescience.html#moment-of-prescience" ><em>moment of prescience</em></a>, <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/scrying.html" ><em>scrying (greater)</em></a>.</p>
<p>This ability replaces alchemy.</p>
<p><b>Psychic Meddler (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a psychic detective receives a +1 bonus on saves against psychic spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. Starting at 5th level, the psychic investigator adds half this bonus on caster level checks to dispel psychic effects. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, swift alchemy, and poison immunity.</p>
<p><b>Phrenic Dabbler (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a psychic detective gains a small pool of phrenic points equal to 1/2 her psychic detective level, as well as one phrenic amplification, as the psychic class feature. This does not allow the psychic detective to qualify for the Extra Amplification feat. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 3rd level.</p>
<p><b>Investigator Talents</b>: A psychic detective selects investigator talents as normal, except she cannot select the alchemist discovery investigator talent. She can select the Expanded Phrenic Pool* feat as a discovery even though she doesn't meet that feat's prerequisites, and she can select an extra phrenic amplification once as a discovery. The following <a href = "../../advancedClassGuide/classes/investigator.html" >investigator talents</a> complement the psychic detective archetype: confusing strike, device talent, effortless aid, hidden agendas, inspired intelligence, item lore, and unconventional inspiration. This ability alters investigator talents.</p>

<h2 id = "esoteric">Esoteric (Magus Archetype)</h2>
<p>Esoterics are drawn to the mysticism of the occult and spend their lives delving into forgotten texts and forbidden tomes. Each esoteric learns to inscribe his spells on his flesh in a complex series of occult symbols and arcane equations.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: An esoteric is proficient with simple weapons only. This alters the magus's weapon and armor proficiency.</p>
<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting</b>: An esoteric has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the magus's spellcasting.</p>
<p><b>Arcane Pool (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an esoteric can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use these bonuses to add any of the following weapon special abilities to his weapons or unarmed strikes: <em>defending</em>, <em>flaming</em>, <em>flaming burst</em>, <em>frost</em>, <em>icy burst</em>, <em>impact</em>, <em>shock</em>, <em>shocking burst</em>, <em>speed</em>, or <em>thundering</em>. This ability alters arcane pool.</p>
<p><b>Unarmed Strike</b>: At 1st level, an esoteric gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He also treats his magus levels as monk levels when determining the amount of damage he deals with his unarmed strikes.</p>
<p><b>Unarmed Spellstrike (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an esoteric gains the magus spellstrike class feature. However, an esoteric can deliver spells with spellstrike only with his unarmed strikes. This ability alters spellstrike.</p>
<p><b>Ki Arcana (Su)</b>: At 4th level, an esoteric's arcane pool is also considered a ki pool for the purposes of meeting feat and ability requirements. Points from an esoteric's arcane pool can be used for abilities that normally require ki. If an esoteric gains a ki pool, he can use points from his arcane pool and ki pool interchangeably (though not special points such as drunken ki). This ability replaces spell recall.</p>
<p><b>Tattooed Spell (Sp)</b>: At 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, an esoteric can permanently tattoo one spell from his magus spellbook onto his body; the first tattooed spell must be of 2nd level or lower, the second must be of 4th level or lower, and the last can be of any level. The spell that is tattooed must not have an expensive material component or a focus. The esoteric can prepare any tattooed spell without needing his spellbook. Additionally, he can cast each of his tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day. When the esoteric uses these spell-like abilities, the tattoo associated with the spell-like ability glows as <em>light</em> for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. This ability replaces bonus feats.</p>
<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex)</b>: At 7th level when an esoteric wears light or no armor, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 13th level. He loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, or while wearing medium or heavy armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.</p>
<p><b>Improved Tattooed Spell (Sp)</b>: At 11th level, an esoteric can use each of his spell-like abilities from tattooed spell one additional time per day. This ability replaces improved spell recall.</p>

<h2 id = "mindblade">Mindblade (Magus Archetype)</h2>
<p>A mindblade blends psychic talent and martial skill to lethal effect. By forming weapons with her mind, she always has the right tool for any situation.</p>
<p><b>Spells</b>: A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell list as psychic spells. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC to resist a mindblade's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the mindblade's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.</p>
<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the mindblade loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the mindblade can cast.</p>
<p>A mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any magus spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p>
<p>This ability replaces the magus's spellcasting.</p>
<p><b>Psychic Pool (Su)</b>: A mindblade gains a psychic pool, similar to a normal magus's arcane pool. At 1st level, a mindblade can expend 1 point from her psychic pool as a standard action to manifest a light melee weapon of her choice, formed from psychic energy. By spending 2 points, the mindblade can manifest a one-handed melee weapon, and by spending 3 points, she can manifest a two-handed melee weapon (but not a double weapon). This psychic weapon can last indefinitely, but it vanishes if it leaves the mindblade's hand. The mindblade can dismiss a held psychic weapon as a free action. When a psychic weapon vanishes, the mindblade regains the psychic energy used to create it. She can maintain only one weapon at a time.</p>
<p>At 1st level, a psychic weapon counts as a magic weapon of whatever type the mindblade selected, with a +1 enhancement bonus. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the weapon's enhancement bonus increases by 1, up to maximum of +5 at 12th level. Starting at 5th level, the mindblade can add any of the weapon special abilities listed in the arcane pool class feature in place of these bonuses, although the weapon must maintain at least a +1 bonus to benefit from any weapon special abilities. At 15th and 18th levels, the weapon gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus, which the mindblade can spend only on weapon special abilities.</p>
<p>This ability replaces arcane pool, and counts as arcane pool for the purpose of feats, abilities, and class features.</p>
<p><b>Psychic Access (Su)</b>: At 4th level, the mindblade gains access to an expanded spell list. She adds two spells from the psychic class spell list to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same spell level. These must be spells of levels the mindblade is able to cast. At 7th, 11th, 14th, and 19th levels, she adds two more psychic class spells to her spell list, following the same restrictions. When a mindblade takes the spell blending arcana, she gains spells from the psychic class spell list instead of the wizard spell list.</p>
<p>This ability replaces spell recall, knowledge pool, improved spell recall, greater spell combat, and greater spell access.</p>
<p><b>Dual Weapons (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a mindblade can maintain two psychic weapons at a time or a psychic double weapon, though each weapon (or each end of a double weapon) has an enhancement bonus 1 lower than normal. Starting at 12th level, each of the two psychic weapons (or each end of a double weapon) instead has an enhancement bonus 2 lower than normal. When using two-weapon fighting with two psychic weapons or a psychic double weapon, the mindblade can use her spell combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces medium armor.</p>
<p><b>Rapid Manifest (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a mindblade can manifest a psychic weapon as a swift action. This ability replaces improved spell combat.</p>
<p><b>Dual Manifest (Su)</b>: At 13th level, a mindblade can manifest two psychic weapons with the same action. She must pay the cost for both weapons. Also, when wielding a weapon two-handed, she can use her spell combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces heavy armor.</p>

<h2 id = "karmic-monk">Karmic Monk (Monk Archetype)</h2>
<p>A karmic monk contemplates the myriad harmonies that guide existence. He learns to use the disharmony in others against them, and to alter his own inner harmonies to exploit weaknesses in his opponents' defenses.</p>
<p><b>Alignment</b>: A karmic monk must be true neutral or of any lawful alignment. This alters the monk's alignment requirement.</p>
<p><b>Class Skills</b>: The karmic monk gains <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> (Cha) as a class skill instead of <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a>. This alters the monk's class skills.</p>
<p><b>Karmic Strike (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a karmic monk gains bonuses against creatures that attack him first. If a creature the karmic monk has not attacked within the past 24 hours makes an attack roll against the karmic monk or casts an offensive spell that affects the karmic monk, the karmic monk receives a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature. If the karmic monk hits such a target, this bonus lasts until the end of the karmic monk's turn (or until the beginning of the karmic monk's next turn, if it isn't his turn). Otherwise, the bonus against a particular creature lasts for 1 minute after the creature's last attack against the karmic monk. This ability replaces stunning fist.</p>
<p><b>Balanced Mind (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a karmic monk receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects with the chaos, evil, good, or law subtype. He also receives this bonus against the abilities and effects of creatures of the listed subtypes. This ability replaces still mind.</p>
<p><b>Ki Pool (Su)</b>: At 7th level, when a karmic monk makes unarmed strikes, they're treated as chaotic, evil, good, and lawful. This ability replaces the 7th- and 10th-level ki pool abilities.</p>
<p><b>Harmony (Su)</b>: At 9th level, as an immediate action, a karmic monk can shift his alignment by one step for the purpose of all effects dependent on alignment until the beginning of his next turn. This does not actually alter the karmic monk's alignment. This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
<p><b>Karmic Disruption (Su)</b>: At 16th level, a karmic monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of damage to his unarmed strikes against creatures of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment for 1 round. This stacks with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. He cannot alter his alignment choice until the next time he uses this ability. Creatures that are of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the karmic monk's class level + the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds equal to the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to having its damage reduction disrupted by that karmic monk for 24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment components of damage reduction, not any other components; for example, DR/cold iron and good becomes DR/cold iron.</p>
<p>This ability replaces slow fall 80 feet, and alters slow fall at 19th level to become slow fall 80 feet.</p>
<p><b>Harmonic Self</b>: At 20th level, a karmic monk is truly in tune with the harmonic balance of the universe. He gains the abilities of perfect self, except that instead of DR 10/chaotic, he gains DR 10 that is overcome only by attacks that do not count as chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. This ability alters perfect self.</p>

<h2 id = "ghost-hunter">Ghost Hunter (Paladin Archetype)</h2>
<p>Ghost hunters devote their lives to eliminating malevolent spirits and putting them to rest.</p>
<p><b>Ghostly Smite (Su)</b>: A ghost hunter's smite evil ability does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good). However, she treats her weapon as a <em>ghost touch</em> weapon against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead of 2 points). This ability alters smite evil.</p>
<p><b>Exorcise Possession (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature. She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability. The target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. This ability replaces the 6th-level mercy.</p>
<p><b>Speak to the Restless (Sp)</b>: At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature's head in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as <a href="../../advancedClassGuide/spells/speakWithHaunt.html" ><em>speak with haunt</em></a> or as <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/speakWithDead.html#speak-with-dead" ><em>speak with dead</em></a> (but affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using the ghost hunter's class level as the caster level. This ability replaces the 9th-level mercy.</p>

<h2 id = "escapologist">Escapologist (Rogue Archetype)</h2>
<p>The escapologist excels at escaping any confinement, whether physical, magical, or mental. Few restraints can hold an escapologist for long.</p>
<p><b>Elusive</b>: An escapologist adds 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on all <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device" >Disable Device</a> and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> checks. An escapologist can use <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device" >Disable Device</a> to disarm magical traps. This ability replaces trapfinding, but counts as trapfinding for the purposes of prerequisites and abilities that require trapfinding.</p>
<p><b>Unfettered Mind (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> check as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her. The DC of this check is equal to the effect's original save DC + 20. She cannot remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes, once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so on. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><b>Impossible Escape (Su)</b>: At 8th level, as an immediate action, an escapologist can attempt an <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> check at a &ndash;10 penalty and apply the result in place of either a failed Reflex save or her AC against an attack that would have hit her. If she succeeds, her contortions let her avoid the attack or effect entirely. Using this ability leaves the escapologist staggered until the end of her next turn. If the escapologist can't become staggered, she can't use impossible escape. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>

<h2 id = "false-medium">False Medium (Rogue Archetype)</h2>
<p>The false medium is a master of pretending to have occult powers in order to manipulate the emotions and atmosphere of the people and places around him, often reaping a healthy reward from the bereaved, who find solace in his comforting lies.</p>
<p><b>Dim the Lights (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, while in dim light or darkness, a false medium adds 1/2 his rogue level as a bonus on <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a>, <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/disguise.html#disguise" >Disguise</a>, and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/sleightOfHand.html#sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> checks, and creatures without low-light vision or darkvision take an equal penalty on skill checks to oppose the false medium's <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a>, <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/disguise.html#disguise" >Disguise</a>, and <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/sleightOfHand.html#sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><b>False Sensitivity (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can't tell the difference between the false medium's scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium's <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium's charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.</p>
<p><b>Haunting Presences (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> skill checks to emulate the effects of <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/dancingLights.html#dancing-lights" ><em>dancing lights</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/ghostSound.html#ghost-sound" ><em>ghost sound</em></a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/silentImage.html#silent-image" ><em>silent image</em></a>, or <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/ventriloquism.html#ventriloquism" ><em>ventriloquism</em></a> by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> or <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/trueSeeing.html#true-seeing" ><em>true seeing</em></a> don't detect the fakery.</p>
<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><b>Rogue Talents</b>: The following rogue talents complement the false medium rogue archetype: esoteric scholar, fast fingers, honeyed words, major magic, minor magic, and quick trapsmith.</p>
<p><b>Advanced Talents</b>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the false medium rogue archetype: feat, master of disguise, and skill mastery.</p>

<h2 id = "ectoplasm">Ectoplasm (Sorcerer Bloodline)</h2>
<p>Your family has a connection with the ethereal substance known as ectoplasm, whether from communing with the spirits or battling the spiritual undead. The power of the Ethereal Plane thrums in your mind and pulls at your flesh.</p>
<p><b>Class Skill</b>: <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/obscuringMist.html#obscuring-mist" ><em>obscuring mist</em></a> (3rd), <a href="../spells/ghostWhip.html#ghost-whip" ><em>ghost whip</em></a>* (5th), <a href="../spells/ectoplasmicSnare.html#ectoplasmic-snare" ><em>ectoplasmic snare</em></a>* (7th), <a href="../spells/spiritBoundBlade.html#spirit-bound-blade" ><em>spirit-bound blade</em></a>* (9th), <a href="../spells/wallOfEctoplasm.html#wall-of-ectoplasm" ><em>wall of ectoplasm</em></a>* (11th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/etherealJaunt.html#ethereal-jaunt" ><em>ethereal jaunt</em></a> (13th), <a href="../spells/ectoplasmicEruption.html#ectoplasmic-eruption" ><em>ectoplasmic eruption</em></a>* (15th), <a href="../../ultimateMagic/spells/createDemiplane.html#create-demiplane" ><em>create demiplane</em></a> (17th), <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/etherealness.html#etherealness" ><em>etherealness</em></a> (19th).</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Blind-Fight, Dodge, <a href = "../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#ectoplasmic-spell" >Ectoplasmic Spell</a>, <a href = "../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#lingering-spell" >Lingering Spell</a>, Silent Spell, Skill Focus (<a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a>), Skill Focus (<a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a>), Spell Focus.</p>
<p><b>Bloodline Arcana</b>: Incorporeal creatures take 75% of the normal amount of damage from your damaging spells, and when incorporeal creatures attempt saving throws against your non-damaging spells, they roll twice and must take the lower result.</p>
<p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: You can control and emit ectoplasm, leaving you less grounded in the physical world.</p>
<p><em>Entangling Ectoplasm (Sp)</em>: At 1st level, you can create a ball of ectoplasm and hurl it at targets within 30 feet. This ectoplasm acts as a tanglefoot bag that can also entangle incorporeal creatures. The ectoplasm dissipates within 1d3 rounds. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Ectoplasmic Reach (Su)</em>: At 3rd level, you can exude small tendrils of ectoplasm that can be used to make melee touch attacks as part of a spell with a range of touch. You can make melee touch attacks as if you had an additional 5 feet of reach. You must have a free hand with which to direct the ectoplasm.</p>
<p>This ability does not otherwise increase your threatened area. At 11th level, this additional reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this additional reach increases to 15 feet.</p>
<p><em>Ectoplasmic Form (Sp)</em>: At 9th level, you can transform into a cloud of ectoplasm. Treat this as <a href = "../../coreRulebook/spells/gaseousForm.html#gaseous-form" ><em>gaseous form</em></a>, except that you can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and you can solidify your form sufficiently to carry small objects, though fine manipulation is impossible. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
<p><em>Malevolent Ectoplasm (Sp)</em>: At 15th level, your ectoplasmic tendrils can lash out at creatures around you. Treat this as a <a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blackTentacles.html#black-tentacles" ><em>black tentacles</em></a> effect centered on your position, but the tentacles can also grapple ethereal and incorporeal creatures, and they do not affect you (though they still affect your allies). You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds need not be consecutive.</p>
<p><em>Ectoplasmic Body (Ex)</em>: At 20th level, you are more ectoplasm than flesh. You become immune to sneak attacks and critical hits and gain DR 5/slashing.</p>

<h2 id = "psychic">Psychic (Sorcerer Bloodline)</h2>
<p>Psychic power runs thorough your blood, whether it be from a familial predisposition to psychic power or exposure to a powerful psychic phenomenon. Whatever the source of this power, your mind is a dangerous weapon.</p>
<p><b>Class Skill</b>: <a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <a href="../spells/mindThrust.html#mind-thrust-i" ><em>mind thrust I</em></a>* (3rd), <a href="../spells/idInsinuation.html#id-insinuation-i" ><em>id Insinuation I</em></a>* (5th), <a href="../spells/egoWhip.html#ego-whip-i" ><em>ego whip I</em></a>* (7th), <a href="../spells/intellectFortress.html#intellect-fortress-i" ><em>intellect fortress I</em></a>* (9th), <a href="../spells/psychicCrush.html#psychic-crush-i" ><em>psychic crush I</em></a>* (11th), <a href="../spells/mentalBarrier.html#mental-barrier-v" ><em>mental barrier V</em></a>* (13th), <a href="../spells/towerOfIronWill.html#tower-of-iron-will-iii" ><em>tower of iron will III</em></a>* (15th), <a href="../spells/bilocation.html#bilocation" ><em>bilocation</em></a>* (17th), <a href="../spells/microcosm.html#microcosm" ><em>microcosm</em></a>* (19th).</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: <a href = "../../advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#focused-spell" >Focused Spell</a>, Heighten Spell, Intuitive Spell*, Iron Will, Logical Spell*, Persuasive, Quicken Spell, Skill Focus (<a href = "../../coreRulebook/skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a>), Spell Focus.</p>
<p><b>Bloodline Arcana</b>: Your sorcerer spells and spell-like abilities count as psychic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components instead of verbal and somatic components when casting your spells.</p>
<p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: Your psychic powers make you a master mentalist, but your soul struggles with the urge to transcend into a pure thought-form.</p>
<p><em>Psychic Strike (Su)</em>: At 1st level, you can overwhelm the minds of those nearby. You can target one creature within 30 feet that you can see; that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or it takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess and becomes shaken for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Mental Resistance (Ex)</em>: At 3rd level, your mind blocks attempts to assail it. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><em>Undercasting Prodigy (Sp)</em>: Starting at 9th level, whenever you gain a new level of spells, you automatically replace any psychic bloodline spells that can be undercast with the highest-level version you can cast in your list of spells known. For example, at 9th level, you would replace <a href="../spells/mindThrust.html#mind-thrust-i" ><em>mind thrust I</em></a>, <a href="../spells/idInsinuation.html#id-insinuation-i" ><em>id Insinuation I</em></a>, and <a href="../spells/egoWhip.html#ego-whip-i" ><em>ego whip I</em></a> with <a href="../spells/mindThrust.html#mind-thrust-iv" ><em>mind thrust IV</em></a>, <a href="../spells/idInsinuation.html#id-insinuation-iii" ><em>id insinuation III</em></a>, and <a href="../spells/egoWhip.html#ego-whip-ii" ><em>ego whip II</em></a>, respectively, as spells known.</p>
<p><em>Thoughtsense (Sp)</em>: At 15th level, you can detect the thoughts of others around you, as a constant <a href = "../spells/thoughtsense.html#thoughtsense" ><em>thoughtsense</em></a>* effect with a range of 30 feet instead of 60 feet.</p>
<p><em>True Thought-Form (Sp)</em>: At 20th level, you can shed the restrictions of the flesh and become a thought-form&mdash;a being that exists independently of its substance. Whenever a creature would kill you, you can attempt to use <a href="../spells/mindSwap.html#mind-swap" ><em>mind swap</em></a>* against that creature as an immediate action just before dying.</p>

<h2 id = "witch-patrons">Witch Patrons</h2>
<p>Some witches draw their spells from mysterious patrons connected to the mind or the Ethereal Plane. Such esoteric patrons grant unusual powers for their own strange and inscrutable reasons.</p>
<p><b>Ethereal</b>: 2nd&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/detectUndead.html#detect-undead" ><em>detect undead</em></a>, 4th&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/seeInvisibility.html#see-invisibility" ><em>see invisibility</em></a>, 6th&mdash;<a href="../spells/ectoplasmicSnare.html#ectoplasmic-snare" ><em>ectoplasmic snare</em></a>*, 8th&mdash;<a href="../spells/condensedEther.html#condensed-ether" ><em>condensed ether</em></a>*, 10th&mdash;<a href="../spells/etherealEnvelope.html#ethereal-envelope" ><em>ethereal envelope</em></a>*, 12th&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/etherealJaunt.html#ethereal-jaunt" ><em>ethereal jaunt</em></a>, 14th&mdash;<a href="../spells/ectoplasmicEruption.html#ectoplasmic-eruption" ><em>ectoplasmic eruption</em></a>*, 16th&mdash;<a href="../spells/etherealEnvelopment.html#ethereal-envelopment" ><em>ethereal envelopment</em></a>*, 18th&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/etherealness.html#etherealness" ><em>etherealness</em></a>.</p>
<p><b>Mind</b>: 2nd&mdash;<a href="../spells/mindlink.html#mindlink" ><em>mindlink</em></a>*, 4th&mdash;<a href="../spells/mentalBlock.html#mental-block" ><em>mental block</em></a>*, 6th&mdash;<a href="../spells/mindscapeDoor.html#mindscape-door" ><em>mindscape door</em></a>*, 8th&mdash;<a href="../spells/createMindscape.html#create-mindscape" ><em>create mindscape</em></a>*, 10th&mdash;<a href="../spells/psychicAsylum.html#psychic-asylum" ><em>psychic asylum</em></a>*, 12th&mdash;<em>create mindscape (greater)</em>*, 14th&mdash;<a href="../spells/psychicSurgery.html#psychic-surgery" ><em>psychic surgery</em> </a>*, 16th&mdash;<a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/momentOfPrescience.html#moment-of-prescience" ><em>moment of prescience</em></a>, 18th&mdash;<a href="../spells/microcosm.html#microcosm" ><em>microcosm</em></a>*.</p>

<h2 id = "ley-line-guardian">Ley Line Guardian (Witch Archetype)</h2>
<p>Some witches tap into the power of their patrons not through a special connection with a familiar, but rather directly through the vast network of ley lines that crosses the planes. These witches can harness the latent powers of ley lines without even needing to be near one of the points where ley lines' powers are accessible to mortal spellcasters.</p>
<p><b>Ley Line Powered</b>: Instead of preparing her spells, a ley line guardian draws the power casting spells directly from ley lines. A ley line guardian is a spontaneous spellcaster. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a sorcerer of her witch level. Bonus spells granted by a ley line guardian's patron are added to the ley line guardian's total spells known at the appropriate levels. This ability alters the witch's spellcasting.</p>
<p><b>Conduit Surge (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4&ndash;1 levels. After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>This ability replaces familiar and the hexes gained at 1st and 8th levels.</p>
