				<h1 id="druid" class="monster-header">Druid</h1>
				<p>Druids are the keepers of the wildlands, the guardians watching at nature's border to ensure that hubristic civilization does not overreach its bounds. From the highest mountain peaks to the steaming jungles and seas, druids learn and draw their power from their surrounding environment and the creatures that live there. Like nature itself, druids can be gentle and succoring or red in tooth and claw, and need answer only to the wind and the rain.</p>
				<p>Presented below are new variant class rules to help you customize your druid for specific terrain types, as well as rules for druidic shamans who worship specific totem animals.</p>
				<h1 id="aquatic-druid">Aquatic Druid</h1>
				<p>Shepherds of the lakes and seas, aquatic druids guard ecosystems ranging from shallows streams to deep ocean trenches, ministering to their residents and communing with the tides.</p>
				<p id="wild-empathy"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex)</b>: An aquatic druid's wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype; however, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.</p>
				<p id="aquatic-adaptation"><b>Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an aquatic druid gains an insight bonus on Initiative checks and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (geography), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a>, and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in aquatic terrain, and she cannot be tracked such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride. </p>
				<p id="natural-swimmer"><b>Natural Swimmer (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an aquatic druid gains a swim speed equal to half her land speed. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
				<p id="resist-ocean's-fury"><b>Resist Ocean's Fury (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, an aquatic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type or the exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: An aquatic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &ndash; 2.</p>
				<p id="seaborn"><b>Seaborn (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, an aquatic druid gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious trait, and a swim speed equal to her land speed. She also can endure cold climate effects as if using <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/endureElements.html#endure-elements" >endure elements</a></i>. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
				<p id="deep-diver"><b>Deep Diver (Ex)</b>: At 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/blackTentacles.html#black-tentacles" >black tentacles</a></i>, <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/crushingHand.html#crushing-hand" >crushing hand</a></i>). She never takes pressure damage from deep water. This ability replaces a thousand faces. </p>
				<h1 id="arctic-druid">Arctic Druid</h1>
				<p>An arctic druid watches over the stark landscape of the far frozen reaches of the world, tending the stunted and rugged life that ekes out its survival in the least habitable climes.</p>
				<p id="arctic-native"><b>Arctic Native (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an arctic druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (geography), <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a>, and <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in cold or icy terrain, and she cannot be tracked in cold or icy terrain. This ability replaces woodland stride. </p>
				<p id="icewalking"><b>Icewalking (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an arctic druid suffers no penalty to speed or on <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb" >Climb</a>, or <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a> checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
				<p id="arctic-endurance"><b>Arctic Endurance (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, an arctic druid ignores the effects of a cold climate as if using <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/endureElements.html#endure-elements" >endure elements</a></i>. She is also immune to being dazzled. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: An arctic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level &ndash; 2.</p>
				<p id="snowcaster"><b>Snowcaster (Su)</b>: At 9th level, an arctic druid can see normally in <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/iceStorm.html#ice-storm" >ice storm</a></i>, <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/sleetStorm.html#sleet-storm" >sleet storm</a></i>, or similar natural snowstorms.

				<p id="nature-bond"><b>Nature Bond</b>: A serpent shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a snake. If choosing a domain, the serpent shaman must choose from the Animal, Charm, Trickery, and Water domains.</p>
				<p id="wild-empathy"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex)</b>: A serpent shaman can use wild empathy with reptiles as a full-round action with a +4 bonus. </p>
				<p id="totem-transformation"><b>Totem Transformation (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a serpent shaman may adopt an aspect of the snake while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (climb speed 20 feet, swim speed 20 feet), scales (+2 natural armor bonus to AC), senses (low-light vision, scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], poison [<i>frequency </i>1 round (6), <i>effect</i> 1 Con damage, <i>Cure </i>1 save, Con-based DC] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to grapple). While using totem transformation, the serpent shaman may speak normally and can cast <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/speakWithAnimals.html#speak-with-animals" >speak with animals</a></i> (reptiles only) at will.</p>
				<p id="totemic-summons"><b>Totemic Summons (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a serpent shaman may cast <i>summon nature's ally</i> as a standard action when summoning snakes, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability. </p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a serpent shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level &ndash; 2. If she takes on the form of a snake, she instead uses her druid level + 2. </p>
				<p id="bonus-feat"><b>Bonus Feat</b>: At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a serpent shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#combat-expertise" >Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-feint" >Improved Feint</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#skill-focus" >Skill Focus</a> (<a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a>), <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#stealthy" >Stealthy</a>, or <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#strike-back" >Strike Back</a>. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
				<h2 id="wolf-shaman">Wolf Shaman</h2>
				<p>A shaman with this totem calls upon the clever wolf, capable of roaming alone yet wise enough to run with a pack when facing dangers too great for one alone.</p>
				<p id="nature-bond"><b>Nature Bond</b>: A wolf shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a wolf. If choosing a domain, the wolf shaman must choose from the Animal, Community, Liberation, and Travel domains.</p>
				<p id="wild-empathy"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex)</b>: A wolf shaman can use wild empathy with canines as a full-round action with a +4 bonus. </p>
				<p id="totem-transformation"><b>Totem Transformation (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a wolf shaman may adopt an aspect of the wolf while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (+20 enhancement bonus to land speed), senses (low-light vision, scent, +4 racial bonus to <a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> when tracking by scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4 plus trip] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to trip). While using totem transformation, the wolf shaman may speak normally and can cast <i><a href="../../coreRulebook/spells/speakWithAnimals.html#speak-with-animals" >speak with animals</a></i> (canines only) at will.</p>
				<p id="totemic-summons"><b>Totemic Summons (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a wolf shaman may cast <i>summon nature's ally</i> as a standard action when summoning canines, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.</p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a wolf shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level &ndash; 2. If she takes on the form of a canine, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
				<p id="bonus-feat"><b>Bonus Feat</b>: At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a wolf shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#greater-trip" >Greater Trip</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-trip" >Improved Trip</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#mobility" >Mobility</a>, <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#skill-focus" >Skill Focus</a> (<a href="../../coreRulebook/skills/stealth.html#stealth" >Stealth</a>), or <a href="../../coreRulebook/feats.html#spring-attack" >Spring Attack</a>.
