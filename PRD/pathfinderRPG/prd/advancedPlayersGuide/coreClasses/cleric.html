				<h1 id="cleric" class="monster-header">Cleric</h1>
				<p>Clerics are messengers and servants of the gods, venturing forth into the world to spread their patrons' gospel through compassion, reason, bargaining, or righteous conquest. They are the bearers of divine guidance&mdash;and divine wrath. From gentle and penitent village priests to holy warriors and church heads whose decrees can rock nations and foment upheaval across entire worlds, clerics are everywhere, their callings and methods as varied as the gods they serve. They are living proof of the gods' power and interest in the world of mortals, and to deny them is to invite destruction, both in this world and the next.</p>
				<h1 id="subdomains">Subdomains</h1>
				<p>Presented in the section below are new rules for subdomains&mdash;more specific focuses for clerical worship and power that allow players greater flexibility in customizing their characters. Every domain has a number of subdomains associated with it (see <a href="#table-2-11:-subdomains">Table: Subdomains</a> for a complete list). Each subdomain replaces a granted power and a number of spells in the domain's granted spell list. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) are detailed in Chapter 5 of this book. A cleric who chooses a subdomain must have access to both the domain and its subdomain from her deity. If a cleric selects a subdomain, she cannot select its associated domain as her other domain choice (in effect, the subdomain replaces its associated domain). Subdomains are treated as equivalent to their associated domain for any effect or prerequisite based on domains. If a subdomain has two associated domains, the cleric can only select the subdomain for one of her domains. Subdomains can be selected by Druids (except the metal subdomain) and inquisitors (if their deity allows it).</p>
				<p>If a subdomain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's cleric level + her Wisdom modifier.</p>
