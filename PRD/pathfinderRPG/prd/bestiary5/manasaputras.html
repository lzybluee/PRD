<h1 id = "manasaputra" class = "monster-header">Manasaputra</h1>
<p>For most creatures, the path to self-perfection ends as all mortal pursuits do: in death. For a few, however, the path to self-perfection ends with fiery rebirth in the heart of the Positive Energy Plane, where the souls of those not yet born fuse with the potential of those who've learned from lifetimes of reincarnation to form wholly new entities&mdash;the manasaputras. These outsiders continue their path to perfection by striving to achieve oneness with the universe, further evolving and discovering new cosmic truths, as well as guiding mortals on their paths to similar ends.</p>
<p>Manasaputras are benevolent and compassionate entities that follow strict practices of contemplation, introspection, and meditation. Others often view their directness and disciplined nature as inflexible, yet in truth, manasaputras are accepting when presented with new ideas and challenges&mdash;adapting to accommodate these changes can simply take hundreds or thousands of years as the manasaputras gradually evaluate and reevaluate the slightest adjustment to their personal beliefs or ideals. The patience of manasaputras is legendary, and can make action seem like inaction from a mortal's perspective of time.</p>
<p>Manasaputras belong to a complex hierarchy. While immortal beings known as kumaras ostensibly lead them, each manasaputra operates as an individual, free to pursue its own contemplation of the multiverse and its inhabitants. More powerful manasaputras mentor younger and less experienced ones, particularly when their paths to perfection align. These relationships are master and apprentice structures similar to the Material Plane's monastic hierarchies. Lesser manasaputras have deep respect and reverence for the elders of their kind and the phenomenal&mdash;often godlike&mdash;power they wield.</p>
<p>When not contemplating reality in isolation at the heart of the Positive Energy Plane, manasaputras can be found drifting through the Astral Plane in search of wisdom, or drawn to the Material Plane when ignorance and chaos work hand in hand with cruelty and evil. Manasaputras do not often intervene in destructive events, preferring to instead aid mortals and teach them necessary skills that they can use to confront these challenges. Greater threats of a more cosmic nature can draw the direct intervention of dozens of manasaputras, especially when these threats concern the destruction of knowledge or foment disorder in the universe. To this end, manasaputras can sometimes be found working alongside aeons and inevitables on morally compatible agendas. Manasaputras respect the precious balance aeons bring to the planes, as well as inevitables' unfaltering dedication to their assigned tasks. They are distant toward most good-aligned outsiders, unable to fully share the passions of agathions and azatas, and put off by the zeal of angels and archons. They share a special kinship with devas, who often also oversee mortal affairs. Among outsiders, their greatest rivals are the sahkils of the Ethereal Plane, who attempt to hold back mortal development and are thus sworn enemies of all manasaputras.</p>
<p>Manasaputras seldom interact with wicked mortal creatures of the Material Plane. Their charge is to nurture the spiritual development of those who walk the path of enlightenment, and thus have little concern for mortal creatures outside that path, except as obstacles their students must overcome.</p>
<p>While usually described as humanoid in form, most manasaputras are wholly incorporeal entities forged of the raw Cosmic Fire from the heart of the Positive Energy Plane. When a manasaputra chooses to become corporeal, it usually adopts a resplendent, idealized humanoid form, often with striking features such as a third eye, multiple arms, or other compelling physical characteristics that clearly set it apart from mortals.</p>
<p>Occult lore suggests the enormous wisdom of the eldest manasaputras derives from their mortal existence during a previous incarnation of the multiverse itself. Certainly the manasaputras themselves favor doctrines of cycles such as reincarnation. Some mortal followers believe that manasaputras from the previous multiversal cycle were the first to inhabit the soulless husks that would ultimately become mortals, but as usual the manasaputras themselves favor riddles over straight answers on the matter.</p>
<p>The Seven Kumaras, the most powerful of all manasaputras, exist at the heart of all creation, each exemplifying a facet of the multiverse. These enigmatic entities rarely leave the Cosmic Fire of the Positive Energy Plane, communing with this source of all life in the multiverse and witnessing events across all creation through psychic rapport with a consciousness they (and the like-minded aeons) refer to as the Logos.</p>

<h2 id = "the-seven-kumaras">The Seven Kumaras</h2>
<p>Seven glory-clad kumaras lead the manasaputras on their spiritual journeys. Each occasionally acts as a personal messenger or spirit guide for mortals with profound psychic gifts or particularly promising souls. While spellings often differ depending on the esoteric source consulted, their number is thought to include the following.
<ul>
<li>Ameuritati, the First Immortal</li>
<li>Ashavashitra, the Righteous Truth</li>
<li>Asoshu Mana, the True Purpose</li>
<li>Auramiti, the Holy Devotion</li>
<li>Hourvetat, the Circle of Ages</li>
<li>Ksathras, the Dominion</li>
<li>Sraosha, the Cleansing Wings</li>
</ul>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Creature Bond (Ex)</strong> Each manu is associated with a single race or kind of creature, such as humans or basilisks (not humanoids or magical beasts); this bond never changes. The manu is treated as both a manasaputra and as the race, creature type, and subtypes of its bonded creature for the purposes of effects that target a specific race or kind of creature.</p>

<p>Manus aspire to elevate members of a specific race or type of creature to enlightenment, adopting them collectively as special charges. Typically, this race or type of creature is chosen from those to whom the manu belonged during its most meaningful mortal incarnation, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>While most manus focus on a people's enlightenment across a single Material Plane world, some ambitious manus follow their charges from world to world, continuing to elevate and guide them as they propagate among the stars. Manus are largely solitary, though they sometimes gather into tight-knit groups called rounds that coordinate efforts to guide their chosen peoples.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Aging Touch (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a maharishi manu in either corporeal or incorporeal form can make a touch attack against a living creature to wear down the creature's body with age, dealing 12d10 points of damage and stunning the creature for 1 round. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A successful DC 26 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Evolutionary Sentinel (Su)</strong> A maharishi manu gains a +4 bonus on saves to resist the effects of a <em>dismissal</em> spell or similar effect while visiting the world it is currently supervising.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Timeless (Ex)</strong> A maharishi manu oversees vast periods of evolution without impediment. It is unaffected by magical aging effects and spells that manipulate time. Whenever a creature under the effect of <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/timeStop.html#time-stop" ><em>time stop</em></a> (or a similar effect) comes within 1 mile of a maharishi manu, the maharishi manu instantly gains the ability to act normally during the remaining duration of the effect, allowing the two creatures to interact.</p>

<p>Serene, introspective, and simultaneously old and timeless, a maharishi manu often sits in quiet contemplation, speaking only rarely and acting only when it must. When it does communicate, it tends to do so telepathically, and phrases its advice and commands as strange riddles that seem nonsensical at first, but grow increasingly meaningful as listeners overcome struggles and grow on their own.</p>
<p>Maharishi manus are at the pinnacle of the manu caste of manasaputras, leading the hierarchy by following directions set by the kumaras and the Logos at the center of the Positive Energy Plane. These outsiders govern the spiritual development over vast epochs, teaching lesser manus and guiding all mortal incarnations toward a sense of perfect enlightenment. Because of the nature of their missions, maharishi manus form strong bonds with the inhabitants of the planets under their care and are never kept away for long before returning to those worlds should they be banished by malicious forces.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Unending (Su)</strong> When a solar pitri is slain by a non-mythic source, it returns to life 24 hours later at the heart of the Positive Energy Plane.</p>

<p>Nearly perfect in form, action, and thought, solar pitris are revered as godlike creatures, and possess souls on fire with the radiance of creation and reincarnation. Solar pitris are in some ways alien to mortal reality, yet strongly in tune with it by way of the cycle of reincarnation. Each solar pitri is the embodiment of a soul that lived thousands&mdash;if not millions&mdash;of incarnations in at least one other multiverse that existed prior to the creation of the current one. Final expressions of enlightenment, these incredibly powerful entities have guided the development of all life for countless eons. Solar pitris possess singular focus on the development of the entire multiverse and all its creatures&mdash;some say even of deities themselves&mdash;guiding events down a course that leads like a descending spiral to another cycle of reincarnation at the eventual end of the current multiverse and creation of the next.</p>
<p>Some occult scholars contend that there are only seven solar pitris, and that they are the seven kumaras. Others believe that the numbers of these creatures range in the hundreds, thousands, or even millions, but that the majority of the solar pitris rest in still and silent meditation at the heart of the Positive Energy Plane, never venturing out into the vastness of the Astral Plane or other corners of the multiverse. Such sages insist that the intensity of their contemplation and meditation is the underlying fuel for the progression of souls, the expansion of space, and the flow of time. Some even go so far as to credit the solar pitris with the creation of the Cosmic Fire in the first place, though like all theories about the manasaputras in general and the kumaras in particular, the details are the subjects of heated debate and very little concrete evidence.</p>
<p>All the various camps of esoteric thought agree that seven of these creatures are known as the kumaras, and that they are the only solar pitris who have interacted with creatures that are not other manasaputras. Scholars generally believe that the solar pitris serve as masters to a number of twilight pitris, and sometimes even various manus, but the exact relationships seem to have a degree of fluidity&mdash;as some esoteric texts insist that this group of manasaputras serve Ksathras, the Dominion, while others claim the same group or members of that group serve Ameuritati, the First Immortal. Many of these contradictions stem from transcription mistakes in ancient texts or issues with the variety of spellings or even names by which some kumaras are known, but others can be explained only by shifts in the structure of the manasaputra caste system over the eons.</p>
<p>The lore regarding the relationship between the solar pitris and mortal races is less muddled. Most stories relate that at the dawn of creation, solar pitris took pity on misguided mortals, who were confused by the teachings and guidance given to them by the twilight pitris. The twilight pitris' nurturing led to overly rational mortals who lacked the compassion and empathy necessary for true enlightenment. The solar pitris intervened, and granted those wayward mortals a favored place in the cycle of cosmic reincarnation. Scholars speculate that this act on the part of the solar pitris was the first step that led to the evolution of <a href = "../bestiary4/samsaran.html" >samsarans</a>, though many samsarans deny this story, instead insisting that they are early forms of what will later become the next wave of manasaputras.</p>
<p>Because of their unfathomably ancient minds and far-reaching plans, solar pitris rarely interact with other creatures. They must restrain their power, lest their very presence prove deadly to other living beings. Solar pitris are creatures of fire, and even witnessing a solar pitri shifting from corporeality to incorporeality from afar can blind mortals. Creatures that come close to a solar pitri are scorched by the outsider's boundless, radiant energies. Adherents of some cults attempt such approaches regardless of the danger, believing that even if they burn to death, their souls will be purified by the solar pitri's presence. Most of what is known about solar pitris comes from the teachings handed down to mortals by lesser manasaputras, the traditions of those samsarans who believe that they are connected to manasaputras (or even that they are some early form of manu), the often wild and fanciful speculation of occult thinkers, the feverish dreams of eccentric mystics, and the few legitimate historical accounts of the various kumaras leaving their contemplation within the Cosmic Fire and interacting with mortals. But even then, only monumental events such as mass extinctions of whole worlds, the death of gods, the eradication of an entire intelligent species, or other reality-shaking events draw solar pitris' attention. Otherwise, their time is spent pondering unknowable truths and guiding other manasaputras from deep within the heart of the Positive Energy Plane.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Anatomical Undoing (Ex)</strong> A twilight pitri adds its Wisdom modifier instead of its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its unarmed attacks, as it has an intuitive grasp of how to unmake corporeal forms. On a critical hit with its unarmed strike, it deals triple damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Cerulean Nimbus (Su)</strong> Twilight pitris are surrounded by an eerie blue light said to be a reflection from a previous version of the multiverse. While active, this light grants them a +4 shield bonus to their AC. A twilight pitri can make use of its frightful presence aura only while its cerulean nimbus surrounds it. The pitri can dismiss the light as a free action, even when it is not the pitri's turn, to reroll any one saving throw or to negate a critical hit. A dismissed nimbus returns in 1d3 rounds.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Lunar Rays (Su)</strong> A twilight pitri can shoot rays of moonlight with a range of 100 feet. A twilight pitri can fire a single ray as an attack action, or up to four rays as a full attack action. Firing a ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A twilight pitri can apply its <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#vital-strike" >Vital Strike</a> feats to lunar rays. Each ray deals 8d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of positive energy damage. <span class="_5yl5">This positive energy does not harm creatures that aren't normally damaged by positive energy, nor does it heal them.</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><strong>Third Eye (Su)</strong> As a swift action, a twilight pitri can open or close its third eye. While the eye is open, the twilight pitri gains access to an additional pool of 45 PE and gains a constant <a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/trueSeeing.html#true-seeing" ><em>true seeing</em></a> effect, but loses the benefits of its cerulean nimbus. This pool of psychic energy is separate from the twilight pitri's regular pool, and is accessible only while the third eye is open. Effects that blind a twilight pitri prevent the use of this ability.</p>

<p>While clerics and oracles spin their own myths of creation, manasaputras tout an occult truth behind these stories&mdash;the current multiverse is not the first to exist and it won't be the last. Like the cycle of seasons and the moon, existence itself waxes and wanes.</p>
<p>Similar to the highest caste of pitris, twilight pitris are manasaputras whose existence predates the current multiverse. Unlike the solar pitris, these creatures started their path to enlightenment in the preceding multiverse, not some more ancient one. During that indescribable existence, twilight pitris were mortals who ascended to the ranks of manus. Surviving the natural end of their native reality, they endured and were incarnated into the current multiverse as this higher caste of manasaputras. Though they are in a higher form, it is one filled with tribulation and challenge, as becoming a twilight pitri is among the greatest trials in the path to absolute enlightenment.</p>
<p>This transition between multiverses has the effect of cutting off the former manus' souls from the Cosmic Fire of creation. This "twilight" forces the new pitris to pursue enlightenment without the fire's guidance.</p>
<p>While these creatures can hover around the Cosmic Fire on the Positive Energy Plane, they are barred from entering it. Some occult scholars believe this is merely a taboo, but the prohibition is more than a metaphysical barrier. These pitris are incapable of the spiritual incorporeality found among other types of manasaputras, which enables communion with the flame.</p>
<p>While some occult scholars teach that this exile is some form of punishment for actions in past incarnations, both twilight and even solar pitris deny this explanation. Instead, exile from the cosmic source is a test in spiritual suffering and self-sufficiency. Without the benefit of the Cosmic Fire, each twilight pitri must look within itself or to others to achieve full enlightenment, which is both challenging and spiritually taxing. Failure of this test leads to either the destruction of a twilight pitri or its continuance within lesser incarnations until the death of this multiverse and the creation of the next. Those who gain true enlightenment from this test become solar pitris when the next multiverse ignites, though most achieve status as a twilight pitri, fail the test, and are reincarnated as lesser manasaputras many times before succeeding and becoming solar pitris.</p>
<p>Because these pitris are disconnected from the cosmic source, their wisdom can sometimes seem imperfect, at least compared to that of the solar pitris. While all twilight pitris seek to expand enlightenment in the multiverse, their actions can accidently work against enlightened truth.</p>
<p>During the earliest epochs of this multiverse, the first twilight pitris sought not only to shepherd the fledgling races, but also to impart knowledge and reason to those with whom they formed the closest bonds. The results of this effort still haunt them, as the pitris' imperfect mastery of cosmic enlightenment turned these races into beings driven only by reason, logic, and systematic philosophies. As these beliefs opposed the spiritual ascension touted by other manasaputras, these early races ascended to become other types of outsiders, swelling the ranks of such beings. In the end, the kumaras had to intercede and right the wrongs inadvertently spurred by the twilight pitris' actions. Because of this, many twilight pitris have chosen to be more contemplative and intuitive in deciding on their courses of action than other manasaputras, while others become more active hoping to make up for this early misstep.</p>
<p>In spite of their alien origins, twilight pitris seek to aid and inspire mortals of the Material Plane. They take great care to search for and study the individual mortals, societies, and worlds that hold the greatest promise. Mortals who show the best chance of becoming some form of manu in their next incarnations are chosen and taught the methods of contemplation, mindfully executed action, and focused meditation necessary to achieve their next stage of enlightenment. At the same time, such visitations&mdash;either to mortals or others of their kind&mdash;can be both a boon and a curse, for the twilight pitris often act in unexpected ways&mdash;their minds inscrutable to the denizens of the Material Plane&mdash;and their lack of connection with the Cosmic Fire often makes them seem disconnected from other manasaputras. A handful of kumaras seek out the aid of twilight pitris when they do leave the Positive Energy Plane, enjoying and finding wisdom in their sometimes alien and unexpected modes of thought.</p>
<p>Relationships between twilight pitris and manus are complicated. Many manus have at least one twilight pitri to thank for their first steps of enlightenment and acceptance into the manasaputra castes, but upon ascension, the new manus intuit how disconnected their former teachers are from the cosmic source of all things. They immediately find the words and guidance of the twilight pitris to be filled with half-truths and blind paths, even though the twilight pitri's intentions are true and honorable. These manus still give members of this caste the respect and reverence they deserve, and understand the importance of this test&mdash;especially since they may face it themselves one day&mdash;but often go to great pains to avoid asking a twilight pitri for counsel. Relationships between twilight pitris and samsarans are even more strained, as knowledgeable members of that race blame the twilight pitris for nearly damning the entire samsaran race to a path outside of reincarnation and enlightenment. While they would never outwardly disrespect these higher forms of being, they are often suspicious of the twilight pitris' guidance and disregard twilight pitris' advice. Some samsarans outright refuse all aid coming from one of these manasaputras.</p>
